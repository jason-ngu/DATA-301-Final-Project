There is endless airtime to be filled: Sky Sports have nine channels, BT Sport three, Eurosport two, and there are also the traditional sport slots on free-to-air TV. The announcement that the BBC would replace Match of the Day with an old episode of Mrs Brown\\u2019s Boys achieved the impossible: it managed to unite social media. Admittedly the common reactions were contempt or disgust but it was still an achievement of sorts. Many appealed for the BBC to show a classic MotD episode instead; others suggested Test Card F would be a preferable alternative to the slapstick travails of Agnes Brown. Although there was no Match of the Day, the Beeb did continue with Football Focus on Saturday lunchtime. \\u201cGood afternoon,\\u201d said the presenter Dan Walker. \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry, no Mrs Brown\\u2019s Boys, but we do have a slightly different Football Focus for you today.\\u201d Dion Dublin, Tim Cahill and the journalist Rob Harris were the studio guests and did a good job in such surreal circumstances. They had the unenviable task of telling people what they already don\\u2019t know: when football might resume, what might happen if the 2019\\u201120 season cannot be completed, what on earth is going on. All delivered the sincere and previously sacrilegious message that football really doesn\\u2019t matter. Another staple of weekend football, Sky Soccer Saturday, was quietly removed from the schedules. Filling half an hour of Football Focus is one thing; five hours of Soccer Saturday quite another. The presenter, Jeff Stelling, did offer his services in a couple of (imperfectly spelled) tweets: \\u201cAnyone need an odd job man. Previously worked Sat 12-6 but now available all days . Sadly useless at most things ! \\u201cI can wash cars, cut lawn, wash pots, shout loudly and tell you how many goals Southend have conceeded. Any good ?\\u201d Sky Sports Main Event, usually reserved for their most enticing live action, was taken over all day by Sky Sports News. This channel is usually the world leader in hype, so it was slightly surprising to turn over and see that they had not turned the entire screen into one big yellow ticker. \\u201cBREAKING NEWS: THEY TOOK OUR SPORT AWAY.\\u201d In fact, the coverage was subdued and pragmatic, with a matter-of-fact tone and a relatively understated yellow ticker at the bottom of the screen. There was no scaremongering, no unconfirmed reports that a reserve left-back from an unnamed Championship club had been seen in Morrisons with a trolley full of toilet rolls and tomato soup. The closest they came to self-satire was with the announcement that Spurs are interested in the Valencia midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. Honestly, folks, it can wait. But the only visual indication that things are different was a slightly dramatic red backdrop with molecules floating around, and the sporadically visible words \\u201cCoronavirus Pandemic\\u201d. There were also an unprecedented focus on the minutiae of the Vanarama National League, where six games were played, and a number of Skype chats with people whose apparent self-isolation was hopefully only for the purposes of their interview. All the main sport channels cherished what little live sport remained \\u2013 and, no, they didn\\u2019t stoop to showing four hours of live Monopoly, or an evening of competitive banter from Lambeth Wetherspoons. BT Sport had live coverage of Halifax v Ebbsfleet in the National League and the All\\u2011England Open badminton, while Eurosport had Gibraltar Open snooker. Sky showed Super Rugby in the morning and horse racing in the afternoon. That aside, there were replays on every channel, and most of the archive footage was familiar. There was the chance to rattle through a few seasons of Premier League Years, or to be reminded, via highlights of the 2015 Carling Cup final, that Jos\\u00e9 Mourinho used to have a lovely smile. Over the next few weeks the past may cease to be a foreign country and become more of a home county \\u2013 a warm, comforting place where we can escape from the alien, unsettling landscape of the present. As any cricket fan will know, there are usually two ways to fill a live sport void: by showing replays or having discussions in the studio. The latter is not so easy when there is no scheduled sport in the first place, and there\\u2019s a significant difference between a panel of former cricketers filling a rain delay by discussing their England top order for the next Test and a panel of former footballers trying to make sense of the biggest health crisis in decades. The way Sky and BT use their abundant archives will probably become a bit more imaginative as we settle in for the long haul. For now, everyone is still trying to make sense of the new sportlessness. Nobody on Sky Sports News branded it as such but there was an implicit understanding that this was an extremely Surreal Saturday.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 862}, {\"title\": \"Nation Perplexed By 16-Year-Old Who Doesn\\u2019t Want World To End\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/nation-perplexed-by-16-year-old-who-doesn-t-want-world-1838374925\", \"content\": \"Following her U.N. address about the existential threat posed by a rapidly warming planet, citizens across the United States confirmed Monday they were perplexed by Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old who apparently has no desire to see the world end. \\u201cI know she\\u2019s from another country, but she\\u2019s still a teenager, right?\\u201d said 33-year-old Sophia Williams of Kenosha, WI, her confusion reportedly shared by millions of Americans who recalled that during their own adolescence they had hated the world and everyone in it and had felt the end couldn\\u2019t come fast enough. \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand why a high school kid like her isn\\u2019t locking herself in her bedroom and writing bad poetry about how nothing matters and everything is meaningless.

The dramatic news came as a Jerusalem court postponed the prime minister\\u2019s corruption trial due to the coronavirus pandemic. Leaders of the main parties met Israel\\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, on Sunday, giving Gantz the slimmest advantage of 61 recommendations from of a total of 120 lawmakers. The endorsement does not end Netanyahu\\u2019s chances or guarantee Gantz will lead Israel\\u2019s next administration. Before that can happen, he has up to six weeks of negotiations to forge a majority coalition in Israel\\u2019s parliament, the Knesset. The success of that scenario remains far from certain. While Gantz will be officially picked by the president as prime minister-designate on Monday, some of the politicians who backed him on Sunday may not also agree to join his government. Fifteen of the recommendations came from an alliance of Arab parties, who may have only supported Gantz to damage their political nemesis, Netanyahu. It remained unclear if the Joint List group, a merger of politicians predominantly representing Palestinian citizens of Israel, would join an administration led by Gantz, a former army chief with whom they have deep ideological differences. Gantz also won support from former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the far-right, ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party. Lieberman has repeatedly stated he would never join a government with Arab legislators, complicating Gantz\\u2019s path to power. The dramatic news came at the end of a day in which Netanyahu\\u2019s prospects appeared to be improving. A Jerusalem court announced that the long-awaited first hearing for the prime minister\\u2019s corruption trial, scheduled for Tuesday, would be postponed until 24 May due to fears of the spread of the coronavirus in courthouses. About 210 people have been infected in Israel, with no deaths. Battling the outbreak, Israel has already imposed a series of stringent restrictions nationwide during the past few days, including barring gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down schools, hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. The upcoming trial \\u2013 in which Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust \\u2013 had been hanging over the 70-year-old leader and was set to start right as political negotiations were to begin. For a year, Israel has been in a state of political paralysis following three inconclusive elections, the latest of which was held on 2 March. In that time, both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister. With neither Netanyahu or Gantz commanding a majority of support, the president has urged them to agree on a power-sharing unity deal. He summoned them for an emergency meeting on Sunday night in the hopes of breaking the deadlock. \\u201cWe must establish a government as soon as possible that will lead our people at this complex time,\\u201d Rivlin said. After months of acrimonious election campaigning, it is unclear if politicians will be able to break the stalemate. In a clear attempt to block his rival, Gantz has pushed for legislation to bar anyone indicted for a crime from heading an administration. Meanwhile, temporarily freed from his legal woes, Netanyahu has urged Gantz and other politicians to fall in line, arguing that the coronavirus outbreak meant the formation of an \\u201cemergency government \\u2026 led by me\\u201d was all the more vital. Under Israel\\u2019s current caretaker administration, the government is restricted in its ability to tackle any major crisis. For example, it cannot pass a budget. Netanyahu said his proposed emergency government could last six months, or that he and Gantz could agree to a four-year unity administration. In that case, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next two years. \\u201cThe state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,\\u201d Netanyahu said. Gantz accused the prime minister of manipulation during a public health scare. \\u201cWhen you get serious, we can talk,\\u201d he said. Separately, in an opaque move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced on Saturday night that he intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the coronavirus digitally. \\u201cUp until today I avoided using these measures in the civilian population but there is no choice,\\u201d Netanyahu said in a televised news conference. The announcement, which needs further approval, prompted accusations of mass surveillance. Noa Landau, who works for the progressive local Haaretz newspaper, wrote an article on Sunday against what she called the \\u201cpoliticisation of the health crisis\\u201d. \\u201cIsrael is already on the edge when it comes to violations of individual rights. The foundations of our system of government must not be undermined under the auspices of a viral outbreak,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cThis really is an emergency \\u2013 over the protection of democracy.\\u201d Q&amp;A: Netanyahu corruption allegations Israel\\u2019s attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, indicted Netanyahu in November. It was the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime. The 70-year-old leader, the longest-serving in the small country\\u2019s history, could face more than a decade in prison if convicted. He faces three separate inquiries, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Case 1,000 The first case, known as case 1,000, involves allegations of receiving gifts such as cigars, champagne and jewellery, from billionaires, including the Hollywood businessman Arnon Milchan and Australian casino operator James Packer, allegedly in exchange for favours. Milchan and Packer are not facing any charges. Case 2,000 In case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of colluding with the country\\u2019s top-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to hurt its competition in exchange for favourable coverage. Case 4,000 In the third and most serious case, case 4,000, the prime minister is accused of offering incentives worth close to \\u00a3200m to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns. How has he responded? Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, alleging he is the victim of a politically-motivated witch-hunt. Is that it for his legal woes? No. There was also a separate case not involving Netanyahu, but his wife, Sara, who was convicted in June of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds for lavish meals, despite having an in-house cook provided by the state.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 1053}, {\"title\": \"\\u2018No Way To Prevent This,\\u2019 Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527\", \"content\": \"In the days following a violent rampage in southern California in which a lone attacker killed seven individuals, including himself, and seriously injured over a dozen others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Tuesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. \\u201cThis was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there\\u2019s nothing anyone can do to stop them,\\u201d said North Carolina resident Samuel Wipper, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world\\u2019s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a shame, but what can we do?

From 2014 she was a member of the national coordination team for the anti-poverty and human rights charity ATD Fourth World. At first, Moraene and her three children took part in activities run by ATD, particularly respite holidays that gave people a chance to get away from the stresses of daily life, and in 1990 she began volunteering for the charity. She offered peer support particularly to families coping with child protection proceedings. Born in Liverpool, Moraene was the daughter of Patrick Nagel, an Irish immigrant who worked as a docker, and Margaret (nee Rawlinson), a nurse. She was named Maureen, and later adopted the Irish spelling Moraene. Malnutrition in infancy led her to develop rickets, which caused early onset osteoarthritis. When Moraene was 13, her mother moved with her to Hackney, east London, where she lived for the rest of her life. Moraene\\u2019s schooling was affected by her physical disabilities and the belief, as she recalled, that \\u201cthere was no point in teaching a girl who would never marry and would need to find work as a servant\\u201d. The residential special needs school Moraene attended taught her only how to carry out domestic chores and left her with weak literacy skills. In 1976, Moraene was working in the Tiger Pub on Wick Road, Hackney, when her first child was born, during a marriage that ended in divorce \\u2013 Moraene kept her married surname of Roberts. After taking a course, she was sent to manage pubs in times of crisis, usually being shifted from one pub to the next every six weeks. When Moraene began volunteering with ATD Fourth World, at the urging of the charity\\u2019s then director, Jean-Luc Penet, she studied for GCSEs in an access to university course at Hackney Community College. She began studying sociology and psychology at the University of Greenwich, London in 1990, but had to stop when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Moraene often represented ATD at conferences and was one of those who lobbied successfully for the all-party parliamentary group on poverty, established in 1997, to hear from those with personal experience. She collaborated with academics at Royal Holloway London to bring people with experience of poverty and of child protection proceedings to teach courses to social work students. Between 2009 and 2019, Moraene helped to design the multimedia project The Roles We Play: Recognising the Contributions of People in Poverty.

Fury, the WBC heavyweight champion, and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements \\u2013 citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence. However, Carefoot now says he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury\\u2019s team to lie. Both fighters received backdated doping bans of two years in December 2017, enabling both men to return the ring soon after. Last month Tyson completed an astonishing comeback from drink and drug problems by defeating Deontay Wilder to become a world heavyweight champion once more \\u2013 and has since been a favourite to win the BBC\\u2019s sports personality of the year award. However, the Furys\\u2019 careers could be on the line if Ukad finds the account of Carefoot, given to the Mail on Sunday, to be credible. Both men could face charges of \\u201ctampering with an investigation\\u201d \\u2013 and because it would count as a fresh case, they could receive as much as an eight-year ban if found guilty. In a statement, Ukad said: \\u201cWe will always review any potential evidence in relation to any anti-doping offence, and take investigatory action where necessary. If anyone has information that could be of interest to Ukad and its investigations on any matter, we urge them to contact us.\\u201d While the cousins insisted to Ukad investigators during the original case that they never intentionally cheated, Carefoot says that he was visited in November 2016 by a friend who knew a member of the Fury entourage. Carefoot alleges he was asked to lie by saying he sourced the boar for the Furys, despite having never delivered boar to them. Carefoot also signed two witness statements confirming he had been the supplier to Team Fury, which were forwarded to Ukad via lawyers and the Mail on Sunday said it had seen. According to the paper, the second statement included a line that read: \\u201cI supplied a range of animal meats and offal to Team Fury, including wild boar and pigs.\\u201d Carefoot now claims those statements were lies, telling the paper: \\u201cI have never kept wild boar. I have never killed a wild boar.\\u201d When asked if he had been willing to commit perjury for the Furys, Carefoot said: \\u201cI suppose if I\\u2019d had to. I was in too deep. They were dangling this carrot. I thought, you\\u2019re going to get 25 grand for this, it\\u2019s not a hanging matter. So I went along with it.\\u201d Carefoot, who says he was never paid the money he claims he was promised, also told the paper: \\u201cI feel sick of the lies and deceit and the public need to know the truth.\\u201d Neither Fury has commented on the allegations, but their management team MTK has been asked for a response. However, Tyson Fury\\u2019s promoter Frank Warren insisted the claims were false and he didn\\u2019t expect them to go any further. \\u201cTyson has never ever met this man and his story is total bullshit,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe farmer making these outrageous allegations sent me a letter last October, full of errors and basically telling me he had committed perjury by signing statements under oath and lying. When I called him, he asked for money. I told him to clear off and get in contact with Ukad. He chose not to speak to Ukad but instead speak to a newspaper. \\u201cHow anybody can take this man seriously is beyond belief. We\\u2019ll leave this with Ukad to look into and don\\u2019t expect it to go any further. It looks like while the football season has been paused, there\\u2019s nothing to write about and silly season has instead commenced.\\u201d Mauricio Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council whose belt Fury won from Wilder in Las Vegas last month, said the allegations would have \\u201cno impact\\u201d on his reign as champion. \\u201cPersonally, I prefer to believe Tyson Fury ahead of someone who has already admitted to lying in legal documents for financial gain,\\u201d Sulaiman said. \\u201cThe person who has claimed he accepted money to lie should be the one on trial, in my personal opinion, especially when he has waited five years to tell his story. \\u201cSecondly, around this time Tyson was not involved with the WBC, he did not fight Klitschko for the WBC belt, it was for other titles, so this issue does not impact on him being our heavyweight world champion.\\u201d Fury\\u2019s weekend plans to run a half marathon were curtailed by coronavirus but the fighter made no reference to the claims in a post in Instagram on Sunday morning. Under a picture in which he and a friend posed in Batman and Robin outfits, Fury wrote: \\u201cWe was doing a half marathon today but got cancel for ovs [sic] reasons, but we gonna do a half marathon at home, Batman &amp; robin.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 859}, {\"title\": \"Fylde form part of English football's coronavirus-enforced last stand\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/15/fylde-part-of-english-football-coronavirus-enforced-last-stand\", \"content\": \"\\u201cStop us if you can,\\u201d screamed a large banner at the back of a stand at Mill Farm, home of Fylde and one of the last places in England where it was possible to watch a game of football on Saturday. It would have formed a feisty response to the Covid-19 virus that has caused the shutdown of the four professional divisions above the National League, though in fact it related to Fylde\\u2019s well-documented ambition to be members of the Football League\\u2019s ranks by the year 2022. In previous seasons the rallying cry has not looked out of place. Fylde have been consistently in the running for promotion and only last season lost out to Salford City in a Wembley play-off final. This season has been a different story. Jim Bentley has replaced Dave Challinor as manager, several new players are still being bedded in, and even after beating Aldershot at the weekend the Coasters are still second bottom in the table. While Bentley is encouraged by two wins on the trot after reaching March without beating anyone in the league since November, there is no denying Fylde are currently closer to National League North than the Valhalla of League Two, and if the season ends in relegation the self-imposed deadline of 2022 will look more unlikely than ever. But then again, the season might not end in relegation. For all anyone knows the season might not even end. \\u201cAs things stand,\\u201d the stadium announcer intoned gravely at half-time as spectators on the terraces shook their heads and smiled at each other, \\u201cthe next home game will be against Maidenhead on March 24th. Suddenly that seems a long way off. Government advice may change.\\u201d Government advice is already changing to the extent of an expected ban on mass gatherings of more than 500, which would account for Fylde, even though their stadium is so Lilliputian in scale that two balls had disappeared over the stands and into the Lancashire countryside before the Aldershot game was 10 minutes old. The attendance of 1,668 was slightly higher than usual, boosted by a few Sunderland fans who had booked a weekend in Blackpool in advance of a postponement and some Plymouth Argyle followers who had done the same around a fixture at Morecambe, but there was no sign of a significant influx of floating voters desperate for a weekend fix from any of the footballing communities around Kirkham. There are plenty of football strongholds around Kirkham too. Well-served by motorways, Mill Farm is a short hop from Blackpool, Preston and Blackburn, and in easy reach of almost anywhere in the Merseyside and Manchester conurbations. The same cannot be said of National League form team Barrow, staging a convincing campaign to regain Football League status from what Mike Harding once described as the world\\u2019s biggest cul-de-sac, though anyone who fancied a long drive to take a look at the league leaders on Saturday would have been disappointed. Rather ominously their game against Wrexham was one of several in the division called off a few hours before kick-off due to players reporting symptoms of coronavirus. For that reason alone it is hard to see National League games escaping the fate of the rest of professional football, and among the crowd on Saturday there was a strong feeling that this was merely a stay of execution rather than any sort of business as usual. Aldershot supporter Guy Owen was at the game with his sons, Harvey and Joe. \\u201cWe are based in Lancashire so we didn\\u2019t have to come far,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut we got the idea this might be the last chance to see Aldershot for a while so we thought we had better take it.\\u201d Christel Aspinall, Fylde supporter and seller of raffle tickets outside the main stand, was equally pessimistic. \\u201cIt would be just our luck if the season had to stop just when we are turning a corner,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve not had much to cheer about in the last few months, just about everything has gone wrong that could have gone wrong, now this comes along just when we have started to pick up a few points. When you see what\\u2019s happening on the news though, it\\u2019s not really football that matters is it?\\u201d Absolutely no one believes the position of football teams relative to each other in the table is of any consequence when set against the real world emergency currently facing the country, yet even pre-apocalyptic football retains the capacity to grip and become its own centre of attention. Early in the second half, with Fylde leading through Danny Philliskirk\\u2019s first half goal that would eventually prove the winner, the home bench became visibly annoyed at the game continuing while Luke Burke lay injured in the middle of the pitch. The referee Andrew Kitchen had several opportunities to stop the game, but didn\\u2019t, and Aldershot had several opportunities to put the ball out of play but chose instead to keep recirculating possession. Tempers inevitably boiled over when the two adjacent dugouts rose to their feet in a scrum of shoving and swearing, and though no punches were exchanged \\u2013 there was obviously no time for anyone to wash their hands \\u2013 Aldershot manager Danny Searle and Fylde goalkeeping coach Lee Jones ended up with a yellow card apiece for literally going head to head. They probably felt quite silly afterwards, especially so if the fixtures are about to dry up. Burke\\u2019s injury did not turn out to be serious and by the end of the game all animosity between benches was forgotten. Indeed, Bentley was already considering the next challenge. Meaning Sutton United away on Tuesday, not Covid-19. \\u201cIt\\u2019s important not to look too far ahead when preparing for games,\\u201d the Fylde manager said.

The 24-hectare site, located between two canals in the middle of the city, is a business park but by 2024 it is hoped the area will enhance Utrecht\\u2019s reputation as a bicycling capital of Europe. The Dutch city built the Netherlands\\u2019 first bike lane in 1885 and last year it unveiled the world\\u2019s largest multistorey bike park area with space to accommodate 12,500 bicycles of all shapes and sizes. The new-build Merwede district of 6,000 homes is expected to be serviced by about 20,000 bicycles. \\u201cIt should be easier to get a bike than it should be to get a car,\\u201d the project\\u2019s architect, Marco Broekman, said of the philosophy behind the development. Construction on the first homes is expected in 2022. Two new primary schools and health centres, a high school, a sports centre and shops and businesses will also be built on the site, which will be accessible to the rest of the city, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, by bike lanes and trams. Only four dead-end roads of 60 metres in length will protrude into the car-free idyll to allow \\u201clogistical\\u201d access for petrol-guzzling vehicles into the district\\u2019s outer fringes. Underground garages alongside the \\u201clogistical roads\\u201c will offer 1,800 parking spaces for those who cannot quit their addiction to the car, equating to one car for every three households. The parking spaces will be available for use at a heavy cost and are to remain unassigned to dissuade use. Alongside them will be 300 shared cars for residents\\u2019 use. The closest alternative parking will be 3km away. For shopping deliveries, and for the removal of rubbish from the new car-free streets, it is expected small electric vehicles will be deployed to trundle from the \\u201clogistical roads\\u201d to the homes and back. The Merwede district will boast the largest underground heat and cold storage facility in the Netherlands, using water from the Merwedekanaal to cool it. The roofs of the district\\u2019s buildings will be filled with greenery or solar panels, which would cover three hectares if put side to side. Broekman said he and his collaborators had been inspired by smaller-scale projects in Paris and a 600-home development in Amsterdam\\u2019s Gemeente Waterleiding district, but that he believed the scale of the project was unique. He said: \\u201cBy having this car-free area, we can design spaces without the straitjacket rules of the car, and thus focus on essentials for a high-density area, which is the quality of public space, city on eye level, green, biodiversity, climate adaptation and meeting places for social interaction.\\u201d Kees Diepeveen, the alderman responsible for the city district, known as the Merwedekanaalzone, said Utrecht was rapidly growing and the behaviour of its citizens was changing as quickly. He said: \\u201cWe have the highest number of shared cars [per capita] in the Netherlands. It is amazing to see how the average household is changing its habits. This especially counts for the younger generations.\\u201d Merwede, a third of whose land is owned by the municipality with the rest belonging to private entities, follows the example of Vauban in Germany, which is home to more than 5,000 people. Residents there must confirm once a year that they do not own a car or otherwise purchase a space in a multistorey car park on the edge of the district.

When you wander around the alleys and squares, you begin to feel like the protagonist of a post-apocalyptic film, constantly asking yourself, \\u201cWhere is everyone?\\u201d If you do see a solitary human, their reaction is diffidence, if not alarm: they adjust their face mask and move away. The habitual warmth of Italians has been replaced by self-preserving coolness. A very touchy-feely country is now obsessed by personal space. That eerie sense of living in the end times only increases when you watch the news. Prison riots erupted across the country last week. There was a mass break-out in Foggia (six inmates are still at large). At Milan\\u2019s San Vittore prison, black smoke was seen gushing from the windows, and seven inmates died in violence in Modena. The police patrols and blockades only make things feel more ominous. Free movement within a borderless Europe already seems like a distant memory: there were 90km queues on the Brenner pass (into Austria) last week, and Slovenia has blocked its roads with Italy. It is understandable that Italy, the country with the highest rate of coronavirus infections outside China, should be isolated, but to Italians it feels as if the country is being left to rot. Italy has received more aid from China than from the US or the EU. Every day the numbers of Italy\\u2019s infections and deaths leap by 20% or 30%. Parma is in the Emilia-Romagna region, where so far more than 2,000 people have tested positive and more than 200 have died. In the province of Parma there have been more than 518 cases. One of those, Giovanna, is a close family friend. It feels as if the darkness just keeps getting closer. The intensive care units are now all full. Hospital wards are spilling out into corridors, tents, car parks, gardens and commercial warehouses. We are hearing words \\u2013 like \\u201ctriage\\u201d \\u2013 which are usually associated with warfare. Medics and nurses are having to make decisions on which patients to prioritise. Some doctors have died, and others have compared the numbers of admissions to dealing with \\u201can earthquake every day\\u201d. Part of the weirdness comes from that fact that you can\\u2019t go anywhere. Museums, gyms, schools, cinemas and libraries are all closed. Your instinct is to hunker down with the wider family, but all the advice is to stay away from the older generation, who are the most vulnerable to infection. You can\\u2019t gather round those who, like Giovanna, are ill. Not even her ailing husband is allowed close to her. You can\\u2019t go to church because they, too, are now closed. I would like to head to my mother-in-law\\u2019s house in the hills, but we\\u2019re not allowed out of the city. It\\u2019s amazing how quickly you become used to new habits: not getting in the lift with other people or standing well apart in a queue (normally we\\u2019re bunched tight to foil the queue-bargers). When you ask a shopkeeper for a loaf of bread, they put it on the counter then step away. You pick it up, pay and step away. They put your change out and move back as you move forward. You feel like repelling magnets. Some friends are fretful, washing their hands every half-hour or putting on surgical gloves to open doors. It\\u2019s hard not to begin to doubt your own sanity and wonder whether it\\u2019s rational to be following all these restrictions and rituals. Then, last Wednesday night, another emergency decree ramped up the restrictions: all shops, except chemists and food stores, were ordered to remain closed. If you want to leave the house, you now have to print off a document to explain to police your timing, destination and motive. In some ways it feels a little as you might imagine the Middle Ages. It\\u2019s as if we\\u2019re inside a city with metaphorical walls where rumours abound: that a friend, Marco, has a rasping cough; that politician Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive; that our kids will have to attend school throughout Italy\\u2019s baking summer. And Parma feels medieval because it is so quiet. I\\u2019ve never known it so safe to cycle around an Italian city. It\\u2019s as if the cars, as well as the humans, are keeping their distance. So everything feels softer somehow. I never knew there was someone in the next block of flats who played the guitar. You can hear them strumming late at night. The natural world \\u2013 all the turtle doves and cherry blossom \\u2013 seems brighter or emboldened. That quietness extends to the football. Watching Juventus v Inter Milan the other night (before Serie A, too, was suspended) you could hear, in the absence of the crowds, almost everything from the actual game: the laces on leather, the players\\u2019 groans, shouts and insults. It made them seem mortal, like Sunday league players. Now, of course, several players \\u2013 Juventus\\u2019s Daniele Rugani and the former Southampton (now Sampdoria) striker Manolo Gabbiadini \\u2013 have tested positive. What\\u2019s intriguing is that all the adjectives you might normally use to describe Italy (sociable, excitable, chaotic, undisciplined, polemical, fun and \\u2013 despite all its troubles \\u2013 somehow optimistic) have become redundant. It feels completely the opposite: isolated, calm, orderly, obedient, cowed, dour and pessimistic. It\\u2019s as if the country has suddenly discovered a different, maybe deeper, side. It\\u2019s a sterner, more serious place. It\\u2019s sombre, of course, because there have now been more than 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy. There\\u2019s bafflement at the fact that the mortality rate here is (at time of writing) 7.17% compared with 0.05% in Sweden and 0.2% in Germany. We don\\u2019t understand why we\\u2019ve got it so bad, whether it\\u2019s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56. There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a moratorium on mortgage payments, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country\\u2019s cassa integrazione) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated \\u20ac25bn. The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy\\u2019s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before \\u2013 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy\\u2019s biggest banks \\u2013 Intesa and Unicredit \\u2013 saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank offered no assistance to the country. The response from Italy\\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. \\u201cWe need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,\\u201d he seethed. Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I\\u2019m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi\\u2019s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma\\u2019s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: \\u201cItaly will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.\\u201d So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the \\u201csilly Eye-ties\\u201d had messed things up again. \\u201cThey\\u2019ll never follow the rules,\\u201d said some. Prejudices about Italy \\u2013 assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus \\u2013 meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for \\u201cdraconian\\u201d measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record. From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world\\u2019s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes. Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy\\u2019s literary canon \\u2013 Alessandro Manzoni\\u2019s The Betrothed and Giovanni Boccaccio\\u2019s The Decameron, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy\\u2019s lead \\u2013 closing schools, universities and sports events \\u2013 we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated. Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there\\u2019s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom. We\\u2019re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise. Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we\\u2019re shamelessly giving them domestic chores. They\\u2019re cleaning the fridge and the windows, mopping the floors and hanging out laundry. I\\u2019m also setting them daily challenges with a didactic dad\\u2019s earnestness: if they want to watch TV they have to learn the Nato phonetic alphabet (three passes), the names and dates of the Plantagenet monarchs (two passes), how to tie knots (three passes) or a Shakespeare soliloquy (only one pass). I\\u2019m learning quite a lot myself. But you do wonder what\\u2019s going through their minds. Quite apart from the fear, they\\u2019re dealing with disappointments which, at their age, must seem huge. Benedetta had won, along with her dance troupe, an international ballet competition, the prize for which was to dance in New York in April. That won\\u2019t now happen. Emma, Mozart-obsessed, was due to go with her grandmother to the opera house in Giuseppe Verdi\\u2019s birthplace, Busseto, to see The Marriage of Figaro. That, too, has been cancelled. She has started playing melancholic Chopin instead of playful Mozart. Leonardo, like me, just longs to be able to play football again. In our manic matches of indoor one-aside, we\\u2019ve accidentally pruned the Victoria spiderworts and smashed the odd lightbulb. They\\u2019re finding new passions too. They love playing euchre and blackjack, betting with matchsticks. Leo is teaching himself Spanish and now calls me el padre or hombre. Benedetta is sewing, she says from behind her bedroom door, a suit jacket. Emma is pretending to get fit. It\\u2019s all fairly wholesome in a Waltons kind of way. But they are, like us, getting cabin fever. We don\\u2019t know when this is going to end or what the outside world will look like when it does. There have been eight deaths so far in Parma and, we assume, there will be many more. Parma is a small city. With more than 518 cases, almost everyone has a friend or friend-of-a-friend who is ill. It\\u2019s less important, perhaps, but many businesses, too, will go under. Everyone is trying to be resilient. Children across the country are hanging out paintings on balconies saying andr\\u00e0 tutto bene (everything will be fine). There have been many goosebump moments, like the spontaneous singing of whole streets, the voices joining in complex harmonies through the open windows. There have been laughs: one Roman market stallholder wore a wide, plywood doughnut to guarantee personal distance. But it feels like gallows humour and the songs sound mournful. Since we\\u2019ve been in lockdown, spring has erupted. You can see pinky-white bursts of magnolias lining the empty roads. Daises, primroses and dandelions are suddenly brightening the grass. It even smells like spring. The Parma air is, for once, so clean you can see the snow-capped Apennines from my study. It only makes you keener to get out. But until this emergency lockdown ends, we will \\u2013 except for rare excursions \\u2013 experience the world like prisoners, from the windows of our cells. Tobias Jones lives in Parma.

More than 100 million people across the continent are on lockdown after Spain announced it would follow Italy in confining citizens to their homes for 15 days unless they had to buy food or medicine, go to work or seek medical treatment. Spain\\u2019s death toll from the Covid-19 virus doubled on Sunday to 288 with more than 8,000 infections reported, the second-worst rates after Italy, where more than 1,400 people have died and more than 21,000 are sick. Italy announced a record one-day death toll of 368 on Sunday. German media outlets said three of the country\\u2019s key borders would be closed amid more than 4,500 coronavirus cases and at least nine deaths, with exceptions made for cargo and commuters. Neighbouring countries Denmark, the Czech Republic and Poland have closed their borders to tourists. Austria said gatherings of more than five people would be banned from Monday, part of a wave of restrictions across the continent the World Health Organization says has become the \\u201cepicentre\\u201d of the outbreak. Non-essential shops would be closed along with restaurants, bars, playgrounds and sports venues, the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, announced, warning that the next weeks would be \\u201cchallenging, difficult and painful\\u201d. More than 800 people have been infected out of a population of 8.8 million and one person has died. Vienna has banned anyone entering from the UK, the Netherlands, Ukraine and Russia. In France, where 91 people have died, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and most shops are shut. Plane, train and coach services between cities will be reduced from Sunday but Paris M\\u00e9tro services would continue for the time being, the government said. Bulgaria said it would ban incoming flights from Spain and Italy. With infections exponentially increasing in many countries, leaders of the G7 were preparing to hold an extraordinary summit via video link on Monday to try to coordinate a financial and medical response to the pandemic. International travel and internal movement in many countries will be severely curtailed by restrictions set to come into effect over the coming days. In China, where the vast majority of fresh cases were being recorded among people arriving from abroad, rather than through domestic transmission, the government announced that anyone landing in Beijing from Monday would be quarantined for 14 days in a government facility. Anyone arriving in Australia will be ordered to self-isolate for two weeks and could face steep fines for not doing so, the government said on Sunday, as two more people there were confirmed to have died from the virus. Nearly 250 people have tested positive, according to the country\\u2019s health department. The US on Saturday added the UK and Ireland to a list of European countries from which entrants would be temporarily banned. Pictures from several American airports showed huge crowds of people scrambling to return to the US, raising concerns that the government\\u2019s response might itself help to spark new cases. The UK Foreign Office on Sunday advised against \\u201call but essential travel\\u201d to the US. Donald Trump said on Saturday he had been tested for the virus and found negative. The Philippines recorded four more coronavirus deaths and 29 new cases, bringing the domestic tally of infections to 140, with the entire population of the capital, Manila, placed under \\u201ccommunity quarantine\\u201d for about a month beginning on Sunday. The Vatican\\u2019s Easter services will be held next month without attendees, the Holy See has said, in a move believed to be unprecedented in modern times. Iran, whose caseload and number of deaths are the highest in the world after China and Italy, announced 113 deaths over the past 24 hours, its highest single-day toll so far. More than 14,000 people have been infected and 724 have died, according to official statistics, the accuracy of which has been challenged by the WHO. Those dying in the Iranian outbreak are significantly younger than elsewhere, with 15% of them younger than 40, according to health ministry statistics. The official leading the response was quoted on Sunday warning that the country\\u2019s sanctions-hit health system threatened to be overwhelmed by the virus. The figures came as public authorities continued to disagree over measures to stem the flow of new cases. Some of the worst affected areas called for a quarantine of their cities, but the mayor of Tehran said the measure was not practicable. He has advised all people aged over 60 to stay home, but he is not imposing a closure of shops or offices. Officials are relying on citizens to show self-restraint. A claim by the Revolutionary Guards on Friday that they were set to clean the streets, roads and shops over the weekend did not materialise, with large numbers of people still out in Tehran shopping and behaving as normal. The army instead started screening-drills in a small number of provinces. The president, Hassan Rouhani, said he opposed curfews, and also rejected plans for fines to be imposed on anyone found to be driving while infected. He said it would be a sufficient punishment to turn people back, and gave the go-ahead for roadside checks in 11 provinces. He also announced a three-month grace period for hard-pressed businesses to pay tax, electricity, water and gas bills and banking loans. On Sunday South Africa declared a national disaster and introduced a series of drastic measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak in the country. In a televised address on Sunday evening, President Cyril Ramaphosa told South Africans that the greatest danger lay in \\u201cfear and ignorance\\u201d. The current total of cases in the country now stands at over 60, with internal transmission of the virus becoming more common. Caseloads across Africa are still small compared with elsewhere but there were widespread fears that countries would have difficulty coping with large outbreaks, with only short supplies of ventilators and other critical equipment in many places. The Irish government on Sunday said all bars in the country should close until at least the end of the month after videos of singing in packed Dublin venues on Saturday sparked anger on social media.

The depressions were found in rocks that were formed from mudflats around 170m years old during the Middle Jurassic, the period when the stegosaurs group of dinosaurs were beginning to evolve and spread out. Iguanodon Iguanodons were herbivorous dinosaurs that lived in the Early Cretaceous period. Weighing four-and-a-half tons and growing to 10 metres long, it was one of the first dinosaurs to be named. One of the most common dinosaurs found on the Isle of Wight, an Iguanodon tail was discovered as recently as January. Baryonyx A relative of Spinosaurus, the star of Jurassic Park III, Baryonyx also lived in the Early Cretaceous and prayed on Iguanodon. It hunted fish, too, wading into shallow water and using its 31cm-long claw to hook them, similar to a bear, according to scientists at the Natural History Museum. First discovered in 1983 in a Surrey clay pit, it had a crocodilian-like snout. Ichthyosaur This aquatic reptile, which first swam in the seas around the British Isles from the Late Triassic, is not technically a dinosaur (its name means \\u201cfish lizard\\u201d). The discovery of an Ichthyosaur jaw bone in Somerset in 2016 led scientists at Manchester University and New York\\u2019s SUNY to declare it one of the largest animals ever, while a fossilised Ichthyosaur was found on a Somerset beach by dogs just before Christmas. Thecodontosaurus This sauropod lived in the Late Triassic and was one of the first plant-eating dinosaurs, according to Professor Mike Benton of Bristol university. The species, whose name means \\u201csocket-toothed lizard\\u201d, enjoyed a climate closer to that of Florida than today\\u2019s south-west England, and was discovered by quarry workers in Bristol who found bones embedded in limestone.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 9, \"content_len\": 309}, {\"title\": \"Turn your eyes into a work of art | Funmi Fetto\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/15/funmi-fetto-beauty-spot-eyeshadow-eye-paint-ultimate-red-lipstick-pigmentation-serum\", \"content\": \"Painterly maquillage is all the rage.

Possible changes to the fixture list will also be considered, while a statement issued by the British Horseracing Authority on Sunday evening said the government \\u201chas been briefed on the issues involved in staging the Grand National\\u201d on 4 April and \\u201ca decision will be announced as soon as possible\\u201d. Racing has already moved behind closed doors in France and Ireland while the meeting on Monday at Kelso \\u2013 which is subject to a Scottish rule banning gatherings of more than 500 people \\u2013 will be the first meeting held without spectators on the British mainland. Cards are also scheduled for Southwell and Hereford on Monday, however, and also at Wetherby and Taunton on Tuesday which will not be subject to a ban on spectators as things stand. The four-day Cheltenham Festival, one of the sport\\u2019s most important meetings, took place as scheduled last week with up to 68,000 people in the grandstands on any one day. Hand-washing stations were deployed around the track, but as the Festival unfolded one sport after another decided to suspend all activities. \\u201cRacing has worked hard to look after our customers and our staff by following the government\\u2019s guidance and taking proportionate action,\\u201d Nick Rust, the BHA chief executive, said on Sunday. \\u201cWe will agree plans to limit attendance to participants and staff only at race meetings from this week and put in place the contingency plans developed by the industry.\\u201d In a press release the BHA said its \\u201cintention is to agree a programme that is sustainable in the light of possible staff absences, including in critical roles, which protects industry staff and supports the wider effort to free up critical public services\\u201d. It added that \\u201cdetails of contingency plans have been shared with the department for digital, culture, media and sport\\u201d and that racing \\u201chas continued to observe the government\\u2019s request for a proportionate response that takes into account public health and the impact on jobs and businesses\\u201d. After the Premier League decided on Friday to suspend its season following the news that Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, had tested positive for Covid-19, it was widely reported the government would ban large gatherings from as early as next weekend. No figure for the limit has yet been confirmed, however, or whether there will be a different limit for indoor and outdoor gatherings. Racing is an industry as well as a spectator sport \\u2013 and in particular an important employer in rural areas where other jobs are often scarce. The most recent report on racing\\u2019s economic impact, in 2013, suggested around 20,000 jobs depend directly on the sport, while it has an important role to play in as many as 50,000 more including those in the betting industry. Britain\\u2019s 60 racecourses, which will inevitably bear the immediate brunt of the cost when paying spectators are excluded, operate a variety of business models. Some stage meetings with few live spectators but which attract enough interest from betting\\u2011shop and online punters to earn media-rights payments from bookies. A few stage major, money-spinning festivals such as Cheltenham, Aintree, Royal Ascot and the Derby meeting, while others rely on one or two big days to support the remainder of the programme. Some tracks even change their approach according to the season. Lingfield, for instance, staged 78 fixtures in 2019, and the top three days in terms of attendance \\u2013 two summer Saturday afternoons and the All\\u2011Weather Championships on Good Friday \\u2013 pulled in more paying spectators than the bottom 45. They will all feel the pinch in various ways as racing continues without paying spectators, and require some extra funding to make up the shortfall. With the betting industry equally in need of turnover with all other sports suspended, it is clearly in the interests of racing and the bookmakers to work together as never before in the coming weeks.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 686}, {\"title\": \"Our far-right policies have popular support | Letter\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/our-far-right-policies-have-popular-support\", \"content\": \"In his article \\u201cThe failure of the centre-right could rot the EU from within\\u201d (Journal, 3 March), Prof Jan-Werner M\\u00fcller unashamedly blames Hungary and Poland for the inability of Europe\\u2019s mainstream parties to meet voter demands and develop effective policies on an array of pressing issues. He says \\u201cmainstream conservatives have capitulated to the authoritarianism of the far right\\u201d, when, in fact, it was Europe\\u2019s centre-right that voluntarily abandoned its traditional, Christian democratic values and adopted an increasingly left-liberal view on topics that matter to the voters. Contrary to what the author suggests, political parties don\\u2019t become popular overnight and without reason.

It is the first time a UK or Iranian official has admitted in public that talks on the matter are underway, including the possibility of the debt being paid off through medicines and humanitarian goods. Neither side will openly acknowledge there is a link between the debt and the retention of the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in jail. She was sentenced to five years on spying charges in 2016, a charge she has always denied. Interviewed by the Iranian newspaper Etemad, Baeidinejad said the previous UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had taken a counter-productive, aggressive approach to the issue of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\\u2019s release, but Boris Johnson\\u2019s new government was adopting a different line. He said: \\u201cIn Britain media and public opinion were engaged because of her being a mother with a young child. The ministry of foreign affairs of Iran has also relayed this media and psychological atmosphere to the country\\u2019s judicial system. But it is up to the judiciary to decide whether or not to release her. \\u201cAs we know, classes of prisoners who spend half their time in prison can be subject to reduced sentences. We have tried to advise Ms Zaghari\\u2019s family to think of trying to use such legal and judicial remedies in Iranian law, rather than taking psychological measures and designing political and media campaigns on Iran. \\u201cWe have repeatedly urged the British government to refrain from politicising the case, and instead of abusive actions such as granting \\u2018diplomatic protection\\u2019 to Zaghari \\u2013 which would only further politicise the situation \\u2013 to pursue the issue through legal and judicial channels.\\u201d With regards to the debt, Baeidinejad said the size and the interest was agreed between the two parties, and it was natural for discussions to start from how the payment could be made. The UK says it cannot make the payment since the Iranian ministry of defence, to which the sum is owed, is subject to EU sanctions. Similarly, the pervasive US sanctions make it difficult to make a payment to Iran\\u2019s central bank. Baeidinejad added: \\u201cThe legal process of this long-running case, which has been going on for more than 50 years, is nearing its end. The court has ordered the British government to pay the Iranian debt plus interest, and this cannot be changed. At the same time, the opposing lawyers have tried to use every legal opportunity to delay the practical execution of the court\\u2019s decision.\\u201d He said: \\u201cIt is natural to come up with ideas for the type of payment as the time comes to pay off the debt, given the complexities and banking problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran also has ideas for expediting the debt. Finalising the payment method requires a mutual agreement, and talks are underway to determine the details of how the agreements will be implemented.\\u201d Separately, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\\u2019s family are still pressing the Tehran prison authorities to allow her to be released temporarily due to the threat of coronavirus spreading through Iran\\u2019s jails. Tens of thousands of prisoners have been released, but few political or security prisoners have been allowed out on bail.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 574}, {\"title\": \"Stupid 16-Year-Old Completely Wasting Adderall Prescription On Mental Health\", \"url\": \"https://local.theonion.com/stupid-16-year-old-completely-wasting-adderall-prescrip-1819577948?utm_source=Twitter&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_content=Main&utm_campaign=SF\", \"content\": \"Ingesting a single 15 mg pill of the medication at the start of every school day, local 16-year-old moron Josh Wagner is completely wasting his Adderall prescription on his mental health, flabbergasted sources reported Wednesday. \\u201cInstead of moving 30 tablets a week at 10 bucks a pop, this dum-dum is taking a quick-release Addy before homeroom just to help him concentrate in math class\\u2014what a fucking moron,\\u201d classmate Dave Hoster said of the unbelievable idiot currently flushing $300 down the drain to treat a variety of ADD symptoms. \\u201cHe could pull in $1,500 a semester easy, and that\\u2019s not even including what he\\u2019d get during the SATs.

It is a twist that is also a dare. The circumstances are improbable, the conclusion risks staining the action with sentimentality. To work, On Blueberry Hill needs a leap of faith from the audience. I leapt. Two men in prison uniforms, perched or sprawling on bunk beds, deliver monologues. In Sabine Dargent\\u2019s set, bright pages \\u2013 the colour of the Gaelic Bible \\u2013 dangle from the ceiling: the bunk beds are in a kind of limbo. Niall Buggy is canny and comic as the man who has said yes to everything from crane-driving (when he didn\\u2019t know how) to women (when he had more than enough already). David Ganly is reflective as a former seminarian shaken by his love for another man, slowly coming to terms with the deed that has imprisoned him. They tell their stories separately. At first they meander through luscious recollections of childhood and mothers, and falling in love. Then comes acknowledgement from both that they have committed murder: one of them, in a singularly chilling admission, says he acted on what felt like a whim. Their stories converge. That strains credibility, but still more so does the movement in a short play from terrible violence to behaving like turtle doves. How does Barry pull it off? By giving us a new vocabulary in which to think about his characters. As they reminisce, they accidentally describe themselves and their circumstances. They are \\u201charsh but radiant\\u201d: like the woman, both adored and betrayed, who is \\u201cshining with beauty\\u201d and has an accent \\u201cthat would mash spuds\\u201d. Jim Culleton\\u2019s rapt production for Fishamble, which has already been seen in Ireland (including Dublin\\u2019s Mountjoy prison) and New York, wonderfully captures the idea of bullseye moments, of episodes of an electric awareness \\u2013 the cell \\u201cvibrates\\u201d with the energy of the two men \\u2013 but also a stately mythology, the bringing of shades to life. EV Crowe has come up with a terrific title. Shoe Lady casts a shrewd glance at the way almost any noun slung in front of the word \\u201clady\\u201d becomes an insult: think \\u201cbag\\u201d, think \\u201ccat\\u201d \\u2013 and compare \\u201cbat man\\u201d. She has also brought serious legwork and fancy footwork to the subject of one woman\\u2019s unravelling. Shoes \\u2013 on your uppers, well-heeled \\u2013 are one of the quickest guides to status. And they carry a fairytale history of horror. I might like to think I\\u2019d have been Cinderella but, lacking dainty feet, I\\u2019d more likely be one of the Ugly Sisters, hacking off part of her heel to get it into the glass slipper. Crowe hints at all this in her story of an estate agent who loses a shoe and with it her equilibrium: she has for a time more in common with a street-dwelling cider drinker (also down to one shoe \\u2013 a flattie) than with her boss, whose high heels are glimpsed under a lavatory door. She hobbles, her foot bleeds, she is \\u201cshort of normal\\u201d. Katherine Parkinson, for the most part alone on stage, is magnetic. Struggling not to be wild, she projects an almost fluorescent aureole of alarm. Sinking into darkness, she is often surrounded by hyper-brightness in Chloe Lamford\\u2019s set and with Natasha Chivers\\u2019s lighting. Director Vicky Featherstone keenly enhances the eeriness \\u2013 and towards the end stages a musical number in the form of a wonderful trudging chant. There is plenty to intrigue but not enough to satisfy. The politics are insubstantial. Crowe has interestingly cited Arnold Wesker as an influence, alongside Caryl Churchill. A touch of Wesker-style documentary might have bolstered the episode with the rough sleeper. Disturbance sometimes fades into ditziness. And the account of the actual losing of the shoe is not detailed enough to convince a Londoner continually puzzled by seeing abandoned footwear everywhere. Buzzing with talent, raggedy in structure, Crongton Knights is the second in a series of plays co-produced by Pilot Theatre and theatres in Coventry, Derby and York with the aim of staging mid-scale productions for young people. Last year they created a fresh version of Noughts &amp; Crosses; now Emteaz Hussain has adapted Alex Wheatle\\u2019s novel about a group of teens binding together as they set out on a quest. The holy grail is a mobile phone; the \\u201cdamsel\\u201d in distress (she uses the word about herself) needs it back urgently from her bullying ex-boyfriend because he used it to store sex pictures of her. A number of contemporary difficulties are corralled on to the stage: one girl has escaped from Syria assuming but not knowing her father is dead; another is haunted by the shooting of her young cousin. The script interrupts the action every now and then to thump home various decent points about friendship, getting grief counselling, not carrying guns and knives. Trim some of this spelling-out and there is a fine, stirring event. Simon Kenny has created a spot-on bunker-like set with swarming graffiti. Crucially, Conrad Murray, founder of Battersea Arts Centre\\u2019s brilliant Beatbox Academy, has composed a score that surges through the evening \\u2013 with ballads as well as beatboxing. The cast pull together strongly, particularly in an imaginative cooking number, where they might be part of a giant food mixer. From the beginning Aimee Powell stands out for the sinuousness of her movement and her knockout voice, which is put to beautifully apt use: she sings of the need for independence without accompaniment, as if she is truly standing alone. Another remarkable voice is heard a little later: Kate Donnachie, less soulful, more troubled, snags at the heart \\u2013 and goes to the heart of the project, pleading for acceptance by her peers and for complete individuality.

The directive came Sunday as it was announced that the virus had killed six people in California, with 335 cases confirmed \\u2013 now the third largest number of cases in the nation, after Washington and New York. \\u201cThese are profoundly significant steps and they are significant steps from two days ago,\\u201d Newsom said in a news conference. \\u201cWe\\u2019re guided deeply by what\\u2019s happening, not just by anxiety, not just by fear, but by a very pragmatic response to meet this moment without creating other unintended consequences.\\u201d The announcement affects a $2.8bn nightlife industry, with an estimated 4,765 businesses in California. While Newsom directed the closure of all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs, he allowed restaurants to stay open, but at half-capacity, acknowledging that people need access to food. The call for seniors and Californians with chronic conditions to self-isolate will affect at least 5.3 million people. Newsom said the state is working on ensuring that those in self-isolation will be able to have meals, medication and other needs delivered to them. Newsom also tightened the guidelines on visitation to seniors, limiting them only to end-of-life visits, including in hospital settings. \\u201cWe need to prioritize our focus,\\u201d Newsom said. \\u201cThe most important thing is to protect our most vulnerable.\\u201d All Newsom\\u2019s directives have been guidelines, not orders. Other states and jurisdictions have gone further, with the governor of Ohio issuing an order to close all restaurants and bars in the state and the mayor of San Francisco fully prohibiting gatherings of 100 or more. The announcement is the latest in a series of steps that California has taken to proactively curb the spread of the virus. Last week, state public health officials called for large gatherings of 250 people or more to be rescheduled or canceled. On Monday, 51% of the state\\u2019s school districts will close school for 85% of the state\\u2019s students, Newsom said. Newsom said he felt that California has not reached the point of a \\u201cpolice state\\u201d where officials need to enforce such guidelines. \\u201cIf you want to set up a framework of Martial Law ... we have the capacity to do that,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut we are not in that moment feeling like that is a necessity.\\u201d He pointed out that statewide, \\u201cpeople moved to embrace our last guidance at scale\\u201d. \\u201cNot only did cities and counties embrace our last guidance, they brought our last guidance in at a more granular level,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m confident these guidelines will be well-received and will be appropriately enforced.\\u201d Newsom also announced efforts to expand testing capacity and to bring hundreds of new hospital beds online in the coming days in temporary facilities.

The prime minister, who had been under growing pressure to start holding daily briefings amid criticism of his response to Covid-19 and the media strategy used to explain it, will personally chair many of the daily briefings, which No 10 says will continue \\u201cas long as necessary\\u201d. On Monday afternoon he will also chair another Cobra meeting, where ministers will discuss measures that would dramatically escalate the steps being taken by the UK to tackle the virus. They are expected to discuss a planned ban on mass gatherings, proposals to ask whole households to stay at home when someone falls ill and the move, expected within weeks, to ask the over-70s to stay at home for up to four months. They are also due to discuss the modelling used by the government to determine its overall strategy, which is due to be published soon. The daily briefings, which are intended to focus on informing the public \\u201con how to protect themselves\\u201d, will also routinely feature Prof Chris Whitty, the government\\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser. Johnson, who for most of his time in office has shown little enthusiasm for exposing himself to media scrutiny, announced the plan after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said daily briefings were needed to ensure people got \\u201cmuch clearer guidance\\u201d on what the government was doing and why. All three Labour leadership candidates and Scotland\\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had also demanded greater clarity. On Monday Johnson is also due to hold a conference call with British manufacturers, who will be urged to switch production to start making the ventilators required by hospitals, and he will participate in a conference call with fellow G7 leaders in which he will be calling for global action to fight the disease and its economic impact. Calls for a daily ministerial press conference intensified over the weekend, following at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages over coronavirus, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting was based on unattributable sources. On Friday morning Vallance gave an interview defending the government\\u2019s decision not to ban large sporting events \\u2013 only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented. In his interview Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of herd immunity to coronavirus. But his comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had to distance himself from Vallance, saying \\u201cherd immunity is not our goal or policy\\u201d. The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to \\u201cstay self-isolated\\u201d at home for four months, but his use of the term \\u201cself-isolate\\u201d was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether. Although Johnson\\u2019s decision to front many of the daily press conferences himself will be seen as testimony to the seriousness with which he is approaching the crisis, former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, said it would be better for the chief medical officer to chair the daily government briefings. Burnham added that this was what happened when the government was handling swine flu during his time in office and that everything became \\u201ca bit calmer\\u201d when the official briefings were no longer entangled with politics. Although a poll at the weekend suggests 53% of voters trust the government to deal with the pandemic, ministers have come under pressure to explain why the UK is not matching some of the tougher measures being taken in other European countries, where bars, restaurants and non-essential shops have been closed, as well as schools.

Prospect Cottage in Dungeness, Kent, was the home of the filmmaker, artist and writer Derek Jarman, and has become a place of pilgrimage for those drawn to its stark beauty and enchanting shingle garden. But the cottage will be sold to a private buyer unless \\u00a33.5m can be found by 31 March. It is being sold after the death in 2018 of Keith Collins, Jarman\\u2019s partner, to whom he left the cottage. A crowdfunding campaign launched in January and spearheaded by the charity Art Fund, has raised more than \\u00a32,750,000. At the launch of the fund, actress Tilda Swinton, Jarman\\u2019s close friend and collaborator, said: \\u201cFirst and foremost, the cottage was always a living thing, a practical toolbox for his work.\\u201d Last week, costume designer Sandy Powell auctioned the cream suit she wore to the Oscars, which has been signed by 300 Hollywood stars, for \\u00a316,000. But with \\u00a3750,000 still to find, there are concerns the target may be missed, a scenario that has dismayed Jarman\\u2019s many fans. \\u201cTo me, Prospect Cottage was another manifestation of his visionary, Blakean self,\\u201d said the actor Simon Callow. \\u201cIn its sparseness and formality, he was showing us the world in a grain of sand, holding infinity in the palm of his hand. It\\u2019s the sort of creation that a 17th-century radical, a leveller or a digger, a ranter or a muggletonian might have made \\u2013 a vision of a better world, which was always on Derek\\u2019s mind, even as the molten lava of his rage at the fuck-up of a world made by other people erupted. I guess Prospect was his sanity, his lodestone in a frequently appalling world.\\u201d The author Philip Hoare, who is curator of Queer Nature, a forthcoming exhibition of Jarman\\u2019s Prospect Cottage work at the John Hansard Gallery in Southampton, said the cottage could be considered Jarman\\u2019s greatest work and described it as a \\u201ctarry wonder-miracle\\u201d. \\u201cIt looks like an overgrown garden shed, till you step inside and realise what a queer Tardis it is \\u2013 a little bit of the Renaissance dropped into the Dungeness desert, as dark as the backrooms of Heaven, glittering like one of his film sets,\\u201d he said. Jarman, who died of an Aids-related illness in 1994, drew strength from his garden: his diary was published as Modern Nature in 1991. \\u201cI first read Modern Nature when I was a teenager and was bewitched by his account of making a garden in the face of his own oncoming death,\\u201d said novelist Olivia Laing . \\u201cWe never think of Jarman as a nature writer, but to my mind he\\u2019s the best, not least because he understands nature is inseparable from politics and that it includes sex. He\\u2019s funny and erudite, knowledgeable about old roses and medieval history, but also bursting with gossip and capable of conveying instances of sublime, dreamlike beauty.\\u201c \\u201cOne of the things I find most inspiring about him is that he refuses boundaries. He didn\\u2019t want to be confined by any single discipline, leaping between styles and subjects in a way that feels radical even now. I wish he was still here, but his house and garden remain, an emblem of his life, a site of experiment and openness and restless creativity. As a writer I feel very strongly that we need Derek\\u2019s energy in the world right now. Prospect Cottage must be saved.\\u201d The novelist Alan Hollinghurst, who went to the same school, Canford, as Jarman, who was 10 years older than him, recalled \\u201cthis glamorous old boy who hated the school\\u201d and described Prospect Cottage as having an aura. \\u201cIt\\u2019s long had a shrine-like atmosphere, in a strange quasi-religious way. Jarman was perpetually indulgent.It has a much bigger meaning than merely itself \\u2013 a sort of countercultural shrine. It would be a terrible loss.\\u201d The \\u00a33.5m would preserve and secure the upkeep of the cottage and garden. In addition, Jarman\\u2019s cottage archive, including his sketchbooks and garden plans, would be made available to the public. A residency programme for artists, writers, gardeners, filmmakers and academics would also be established. \\u201cMore than 5,000 people have so far generously donated,\\u201d said Stephen Deuchar, director of Art Fund. \\u201cWe need one last big push, and earnestly welcome donations both large and small.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 17, \"content_len\": 749}, {\"title\": \"Notes on chocolate: the bars I can\\u2019t resist | Annalisa Barbieri\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/15/annalisa-barbieri-notes-on-chocolate-i-cant-resist-tonys-chocolonely-hotel-chocolat-francois-pralus\", \"content\": \"I have, at any one time in my office, about 50 bars of chocolate or chocolate products.

Hamid Patel, the chief executive of Star Academies which runs a string of outstanding state schools in London, Birmingham, Manchester and other cities, says the government should \\u201cdo the unthinkable\\u201d and postpone this summer\\u2019s exams immediately, along with Sats tests to be taken by England\\u2019s primary school pupils, to save lives during the peak infection period of May to June. That may mean requiring this year\\u2019s pupils to effectively start again in the next academic year in September, sitting their exams in spring 2021, Patel said. \\u201cCancellation is the only sensible and humane option. It will go a long way to ensure the success of the \\u2018delay\\u2019 phase of the government\\u2019s strategy. It could save tens of thousands of lives because it will ensure good decision-making, and good decision-making by individuals is central to how we manage this crisis,\\u201d Patel said in a commentary published by the Guardian. \\u201cImagine the scene if examinations were to proceed as normal. Would infected students arrive to sit the examinations that they have prepared so hard for? Would infected invigilators supervise them? Would all students be required to have their temperature checked before entering the exam hall, or would they simply be allowed to cross-infect their peers?\\u201d The Department for Education (DfE) is to hold a meeting with key school leaders and teaching unions on Monday, to brief them on the latest developments and explain the government\\u2019s strategy, including its views on closing schools and when or how to hold exams. A number of policy options are being discussed within No 10 and the DfE, such as closing schools except for the year 11 and year 13 cohorts taking GCSEs and A-levels or BTecs respectively and then closing in June, as well as how to provide childcare for parents working in frontline services such as the NHS, pharmacies, the police and firefighters. Northern Ireland\\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, who has attended the Cobra meetings at Downing Street, admitted over the weekend that UK schools could be closed for 16 weeks, effectively ending the school year. Lawyers in Northern Ireland acting for the mother of a child who has severe asthma and attends a primary school in County Armagh are planning to launch an urgent judicial review of the Stormont government\\u2019s decision not to close schools. Darragh Mackin, a solicitor at Phoenix Law, said the girl is at a greater risk of harm should she contract the coronavirus. He added: \\u201cIt is clear that the respective public bodies have each failed in their respective obligations to our client, and indeed all children, by continuing to require their attendance at school in circumstances in which they would be at an increased risk of contracting the condition.\\u201d He added: \\u201cThe wider international community has spoken. Their advice can not and should not be ignored. It is a deplorable situation when a mother has to initiate urgent legal proceedings to ensure that her child, and indeed children across the jurisdiction, are afforded the necessary protections and safeguards required under law.\\u201d If repeating the whole school year is not practical, Patel argues that the exams should still be cancelled, saying it would undermine the assessment system otherwise. Instead, for sixth formers, \\u201ccolleges and universities could offer students places unconditionally based on their predicted grades from schools,\\u201d he said. Patel has been a founder and chief executive of Star Academies since its earliest days, having been headteacher of the highly academically successful Tauheedul Islam girls\\u2019 high school in Blackburn, which regularly tops the DfE\\u2019s national performance tables for progress in GCSE and A-level exams. Under Patel the multi-academy trust has expanded rapidly, and now runs 29 faith and secular schools, in cities including Blackpool and Coventry. In 2019 Star-run schools took the top three places for highest progress in GCSE results among all schools in England. Many of Star\\u2019s schools are in disadvantaged areas, with a high percentage of pupils eligible for free school meals. \\u201cIt goes without saying that the most vulnerable in our communities will be hardest hit by the current crisis,\\u201d Patel said. \\u201cCoronavirus will not be restricted to those who are socially disadvantaged but it is likely to impact on them most severely.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 738}, {\"title\": \"Aria by Nazanine Hozar review \\u2013 coming of age in divided Tehran\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/15/aria-nazanine-hozar-review-iran\", \"content\": \"Beginning in 1953 and closing in the wake of the Iranian revolution, Nazanine Hozar\\u2019s epic novel is named after its heroine. Aria is a defiant, spirited child who\\u2019s set to embark upon an odyssey across Iran\\u2019s social and religious divides, one whose defining forces illuminate the nation\\u2019s rich, complex past as well as the tensions that will fuel its violent future transformation. Even so, it\\u2019s the story\\u2019s backdrop, Tehran, that is the book\\u2019s standout character. A city of two halves with its impoverished south and affluent north, Tehran is home to Baha\\u2019is, Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews, as well as Muslims of varying degrees of devoutness. International influences vie with tradition, and while women avert their eyes from the male gaze in the south, in the north they walk with their heads held high and their shoulders back, preferring miniskirts to the veil. Tehran\\u2019s architecture of ancient courtyards, alleyways and maze-like bazaars guards its secrets even from the fabled Alborz mountains that rise up above it. This is a metropolis that might well have swallowed Aria up as a newborn were it not for a kindly army driver. Behrouz Bakhtiar is walking home through moonlit snow one night when he finds a baby, just a few days old, abandoned beneath a mulberry tree. \\u201cI\\u2019ll name you Aria, after all the world\\u2019s pains and all the world\\u2019s loves,\\u201d he pledges. For many in this powerful novel \\u2013 women especially \\u2013 the pains dominate. Aria\\u2019s early years are spent with Behrouz\\u2019s abusive wife, Zahra, but when she\\u2019s seven, she\\u2019s taken in by a wealthy childless woman named Fereshteh, who sends her to school. Fereshteh also makes her visit Mehri, a poor woman, to give her daughters weekly reading lessons. Along with this trio of deeply flawed mother figures, Aria\\u2019s life intersects with those who will become communists, senior revolutionary guards and human rights lawyers. A pleasingly restless narrative of shifting viewpoints, it always finds its way back to Aria. A lot is thrown at her, but she\\u2019s a sturdy enough character to withstand not just abusive parenting but also Hozar\\u2019s use of her as a kind of conduit for the city\\u2019s increasingly volatile divides. Throughout, she remains a living presence. Recurring images \\u2013 the fire at the centre of ancient Zoroastrian worship, for instance \\u2013 are used to potent effect, and there are some indelible scenes: among them, the opening pages in which Aria\\u2019s birth mother abandons her and the moment when, as a student, she stands beside a friend whose father is paid blood money by the Shah, helping him throw the family\\u2019s ill-gotten jewels and silks into their Olympic-size swimming pool. Arias, Behrouz says, are \\u201clittle tales, cries in the night. If you sing an aria, the world will know all about you.\\u201d Hozar, who was born in Tehran 10 months before the revolution and left for Canada when she was still a child, has crafted just such a cry in the night. Inevitably, given the course that Iran\\u2019s history has taken, its ending is swathed in darkness. But the naming of another child, this one Red, to evoke \\u201clove, rage, heart, blood\\u201d, suggests a pinprick of hope by way of resilience.

All remaining matches will also be played only in Australia \\u2013 ie, no matches in Wellington \\u2013 due to the government\\u2019s new mandatory 14-day self-isolation period for new arrivals. Also in news you may have missed last night, it was confirmed that the Channel Nine presenter Richard Wilkins also has coronavirus. This was after Wilkins met Rita Wilson twice: once after her show at the Opera House on 7 March and once when she appeared on the Today Extra. A Nine spokesperson said Wilkins \\u201cis not showing any symptoms of the virus and has been self-isolating, on his own at home, since Thursday last week\\u201d. The corporate regulator has told high-volume stock market traders to reduce the number of orders they place by up to a quarter after last week\\u2019s market chaos. There were \\u201cexponential increases in the number of trades executed, with a particularly large increase in trades last Friday, 13 March\\u201d, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission said. \\u201cIf the number of trades executed continues to increase, it will put strain on the processing and risk management capabilities of market infrastructure and market participants,\\u201d Asic said. \\u201cAccordingly, Asic has issued directions under the Asic Market Integrity Rules to a number of large equity market participants ... These directions require those firms to reduce their number of executed trades [a day] by up to 25% from the levels executed on Friday.\\u201d The Australian market, which has been falling since 20 February, plunged as much as 8% on Friday before rallying strongly to finish the day up more than 4% \\u2013 a turnaround unprecedented in living memory. Asic\\u2019s direction comes after the US Federal Reserve slashed official rates to effectively zero overnight. The New Zealand central bank has also made a surprise move to cut rates by 0.75%, to 0.25%. Pressure is now building on the Australian Reserve Bank to make an out-of-cycle cut and bring rates to 0.25%, which the bank has previously said is effectively zero. Central banks, including the RBA, have also been spending up in debt markets in an effort to stop the flow of credit freezing over, as happened in the run-up to the global financial crisis. And meanwhile, while in self-isolation in Queensland, Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have impressed Australians with a courageously thick spread of Vegemite on their Sunday morning toast. Last night Anthony Albanese got his chance to address the nation \\u2013 after Scott Morrison\\u2019s address earlier in the week. He said: I want to assure you that we approach this in a spirit of bipartisanship. We will be constructive. We will support the government to protect the health of Australians, but also to protect their jobs and our economy. Albanese\\u2019s focus was things the government should be doing better, including: More consistent advice \\u2013 such as when to self-isolate and when to get tested Getting more people tested more quickly The fast tracking of fever clinics Expanding Medicare to allow people to call or Skype their GP A serious reduction in large gatherings of people Timely and comprehensive travel advice and restrictions that are updated more frequently \\u201cThere is now no room for delays,\\u201d he said. You can watch the full address here. Melbourne\\u2019s public libraries and recreation centres will be closed temporarily, the City of Melbourne has announced. \\u201cOur six libraries and four recreation centres will close from 2pm today until Tuesday 31 March 2020, with the possibility of this closure being extended,\\u201d the council said. The following libraries, arts centres and recreation centres will be closed: City Library in Flinders Lane, Kathleen Syme in Carlton, Library at The Dock in Docklands, East Melbourne, North Melbourne and Southbank Library at Boyd. Melbourne City Baths, Kensington Recreation Centre, Carlton Baths and North Melbourne Recreation Centre. Meat Market, Signal, ArtPlay and Arts House. This excludes artists\\u2019 studios. \\u201cWhile none of our staff members have been diagnosed with Covid-19 we need to protect the safety of our staff and slow the spread of the virus within the community,\\u201d said the lord mayor, Sally Capp. \\u201cOur libraries, recreation and cultural centres are important community meeting places so this is not a decision we take lightly.\\u201d All of the council\\u2019s childcare facilities will continue to operate as usual. Planning, building, waste and recycling, animal management, and parking and traffic services will also continue to operate. And also earlier, the University of Queensland has announced it will halt all classes for a week, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the state rise. The vice-chancellor, Peter H\\u00f8j, announced that all coursework would pause at the Brisbane-based university \\u2013 including in-person and online lectures and classes. This comes after the government on Sunday warned against all non-essential static gatherings of 500 people or more. The university has approximately 53,000 student and 2,800 full-time equivalent staff, and is a member of Australia\\u2019s \\u201cGroup of Eight\\u201d, a body of Australia\\u2019s oldest and most prestigious universities. Three students at UQ have so far tested positive for Covid-19. But the campus and its libraries and study spaces will remain open. H\\u00f8j also said the university would work on changing courses to \\u201cmeet the new social distancing guidelines\\u201d over the week. And some news from earlier that you may have missed with those rolling, multiple press conferences. Woolworths has announced a dedicated shopping hour for elderly people and people with disabilities. That will be from 7am to 8am, starting tomorrow, at most (but not all) stores. From AAP: Access will be granted if the shopper has a relevant government issued concession card. All other shoppers will be granted access after 8am. Meanwhile, the small national supermarket chain IGA is considering whether to roll out a pensioners-and-seniors-only shopping hour across its 1,300 Australian stores. The idea is being trialled at an IGA in Melbourne\\u2019s Altona, with a shopping hour between 6am to 7am. \\u201cI would think that we could make a decision as a network in the next 24-48 hours,\\u201d IGA\\u2019s chief executive, Fred Harrison, told Nine. More detail on those fines for organisers of events with more than 500 people. In NSW the health minister, Brad Hazzard, announced that today he had made an order under section section of the Public Health Act 2010 that will \\u201cforce the immediate cancellation of public events with more than 500 people\\u201d. \\u201cIndividuals who fail to comply could face up to six months in prison or a fine of up to $11,000 or both, plus additional penalties for each day the offence continues. Corporations face even harsher fines.\\u201d The ACT chief minister, Andrew Barr, has also declared a state of emergency, after Victoria did the same earlier today. He says there are two confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the territory. On Sky, Scott Morrison has confirmed that further restrictions are under consideration including controls on visits to aged care centres and how to deal with enclosed gatherings (rather than mass gatherings in open). Referring to the death of his father over the summer, Morrison said: \\u201cWhen you have elderly relatives in nursing homes you obviously want to see them \\u2013 it might be the last time you get to see them ... That needs to be done sensitively ... We need to lessen the broader risk for people in these facilities.\\u201d Morrison confirmed that the widespread closure of schools was not recommended, although \\u201cspecific instances\\u201d of outbreaks in specific schools had attracted closures in NSW and Victoria. He said the government made decisions based on \\u201cfacts not opinions\\u201d. \\u201cWe need to keep meeting, keep considering information, keep making decisions. When you slow the spread you save lives.\\u201d Morrison confirms he has not been tested for coronavirus, because \\u201cthere is no need, I have no symptoms\\u201d. Speaking to the broadcaster Alan Jones, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed \\u201cscale-back arrangements\\u201d would be imposed when parliament meets next week, including staff not travelling to the capital and closing public viewing galleries. He applauded the move by Woolworths to reserve a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and vulnerable people and said the violent scenes at shopping centres were disappointing and \\u201cnot Australian\\u201d. \\u201cEach of us have got to check each other on this kind of stuff,\\u201d he said. In response to a question about whether banks could be persuaded not to foreclose on small businesses, he said the government was discussing the issue with lenders. \\u201cThey are very real issues,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI am finding the banks to be very constructive. A lot of those practical issues we are now addressing.\\u201d Scott Morrison has clarified that the new requirement for all international arrivals to self-isolate does not apply to their families. Morrison told ABC AM that people arriving from overseas would be issued with personal protective equipment to wear on their journey home, where they would need to self-isolate for 14 days. But their family would not need to self-isolate because they were a \\u201clow-risk group\\u201d, he said. Asked about false social media claims that NSW would be locked down, Morrison said traditional media should not report the claims and the government would reach out to social media companies to combat misinformation. Asked about the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews\\u2019 declaration of a public health emergency, Morrison said that was approved at the national cabinet on Sunday. Morrison has defended the pace of rolling out national ads, saying \\u201cseveral weeks ago we put in place the resources for a national campaign\\u201d. Guardian Australia has reported that a contract for the campaign was only awarded on 3 March but Morrison said the government had taken the disease seriously \\u201csince mid January\\u201d \\u2013 citing travel bans and the evacuations from China and Japan. The number of Victoria cases of Covid-19 has risen by 14, taking the state\\u2019s total to 71. \\u201cMy understanding is the majority again are overseas acquired,\\u201d says the chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton. He also said Victoria would have \\u201cfurther discussions around schools and the evidence for or against school closures\\u201d. \\u201cBut we really want to work through broader strategies for social distancing and one of the key things to take out of this is that there is nothing magic about 500 people.\\u201d Sutton said while there was no ban on gatherings of smaller than 500 people, \\u201cpeople should do the right thing\\u201d. Daniel Andrews said concerns about aged care would be discussed in detail at the national cabinet on Tuesday. He said the advice at the moment was that \\u201cclosing schools en masse ... could do more harm than good\\u201d. Crown Casino has been allowed to continue operating its gaming floor, with social distancing in place. Andrews said \\u201ca number of machines have been turned off so there are bigger gaps between patrons\\u201d. The mandatory self-isolation did not apply to people from Pacific Island nations who had to travel through Australia or New Zealand to get home, he said. Morrison says 80% of people who contract coronavirus have mild symptoms, including the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, and people should not panic. \\u201cOur advice is that eight out or 10 Australians who contract this virus will have mild symptoms,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeter Dutton, who has the virus, joined the national security committee meeting of cabinet by video conference yesterday. We changed our meeting arrangements so people are joining by video conference. The world can continue to turn. \\u201cShops remain open, the power is still on ... we can get about our daily life as best as we can. \\u201cA state of emergency is not a state of panic,\\u201d he says, in regards to Victoria\\u2019s announcement today. Scott Morrison is now speaking on Channel Nine\\u2019s Today show. The host Karl Stefanovic tells him he feels uncomfortable that schools are still open. Morrison says he is still following the advice of the chief medical officer and the experts. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not a doctor, Karl, and neither am I,\\u201d Morrison says. \\u201cI am interested in facts. I am a parent, you are a parent, I think we all have the same anxieties about the health of our kids. \\u201cThis could change in the future and if it does it is because of a change in the medical situation.\\u201d Brett Sutton, Victoria\\u2019s chief health officer, is now speaking. He says the ban on gatherings above 500 people does not apply to: \\u201cAirports, public transportation, medical and health services, emergency services, aged care, prisons, correctional facilities, youth justice centres, parliament, food markets or an office building, factory or site of construction that is necessary for normal operation.\\u201d Victoria\\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has just declared a state of emergency to combat the spread of coronavirus. That is effective from noon today and will last four weeks. \\u201cIt is likely that state of emergency will be extended and will be in place for as long as it needs to be,\\u201d Andrews says. That state of emergency also means that Victorian police can enforce self-isolation measures and punish those who do not comply. \\u201cUnder the state of emergency that has been declared, it is an offence under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act to not comply with the orders that have been made. \\u201cThose orders relate to the mandatory \\u2013 it is not optional in any way \\u2013 mandatory home quarantine or at a hotel if you are not a resident. Now, that is a proportionate and appropriate response. \\u201cThese powers have never been used before,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThat gives, I hope, a sense of the unprecedented nature of this public health emergency\\u201d. Andrews also warns against panic buying and emptying supermarket shelves and says residents should look after the most vulnerable. At a press conference this morning, the New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has just confirmed that police can fine or imprison people who fail to self-isolate, and arrest event organisers who defy the closure of events with more than 500 people. Yesterday Scott Morrison announced new restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus, including 14-day self-isolation for anyone arriving from overseas, and a 30-day ban on cruise ship arrivals. \\u201cWhilst the chief medical officer can issue notices, police can enforce that and there are penalties in place for people who don\\u2019t respect what we\\u2019ve done, through the Public Health Act,\\u201d Berejiklian said today. Yesterday the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaczszuk, said laws passed last month also allowed police to fine people $13,000 for not complying with self-isolation. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, also said similar. When asked if people could also report those who fail to comply, Berejiklian said yes but \\u201chopes that it doesn\\u2019t come to that\\u201d. \\u201cYou can let the relevant authorities know, and the police can turn up and enforce that person to stay home. So we do have that provision. We\\u2019ll be enacting that. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re an event organiser and you have a planned event which will have 500 people at once, that can no longer take place. So if anybody doesn\\u2019t follow those instructions, there\\u2019s a hefty fine and also potential jail time.\\u201d Section 70 of the NSW Public Health Act says it is an offence not to comply with a public health order, and section 71 says police may arrest a person who contravenes public health orders \\u2013 under certain circumstances. But the premier said she hoped that \\u201cmost people will step up and do the right thing [and self-isolate]\\u201d. \\u201cDon\\u2019t just think of yourself and your own family ... you could unintentionally be infecting and causing the death of so many other people.\\u201d Good morning and welcome back to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in Australia. This morning, Woolworths has announced a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and disabled people \\u2013 to combat shelf shortages due to panic buying \\u2013 while the University of Queensland will pause all its classes for a week. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has also just spoken about potential powers the government can use to enforce self-isolation. We\\u2019ll bring you updates from that press conference to you first.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 2738}, {\"title\": \"The UFC\\u2019s defiance of the coronavirus outbreak is reckless and irresponsible\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/15/ufc-coronavirus-pandemic-dana-white-trump\", \"content\": \"In the wake of the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus 2019 a pandemic on Wednesday, major sports leagues in the United States and across the globe have reacted by canceling or postponing events. The NCAA canceled March Madness. MLB called off spring training and delayed the season, the PGA Tour canceled events, while the MLS, NHL and NBA have suspended their seasons until further notice. Yet despite the slew of professional organizations taking action to protect public health and safety, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, has no intention of deviating from its upcoming schedule and has instead decided to move some of its shows to Las Vegas. As the coronavirus \\u2013 officially known as Covid-19 \\u2013 spreads across the United States, a growing number of states have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak, which allows states the authority to establish curfews, shut down public spaces, and a host of other restrictions. Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since announced that those shows (28 March in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC\\u2019s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC\\u2019s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans. The UFC also revealed that Saturday\\u2019s show in Brasilia, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city\\u2019s governor declared a ban on large gatherings. However, it appears that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission \\u2013 the regulatory body responsible for fighter safety \\u2013 was not intending on testing fighters for COVID-19, a troubling development given the contagious and unpredictable nature of the virus. Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which is a virus related to Sars. The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control. As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths. Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks. These include practicing respiratory hygiene, social distancing and staying away from large-scale public gatherings. While sports organizations have interpreted this as an ethical obligation to suspend their seasons and cancel events, the UFC has no intention of canceling any upcoming shows. \\u201cI talked to the president and the vice president about this, and they\\u2019re taking this very serious,\\u201d UFC president Dana White said during an appearance on ESPN\\u2019s SportsCenter on Thursday. \\u201cThey\\u2019re saying, \\u2018Be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking.\\u2019 Everybody is panicking, and instead of panicking, we\\u2019re actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how to keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.\\u201d White added that the UFC plans to screen incoming fans with \\u201cinfrared technology\\u201d that would detect spikes in body temperatures such as those caused by fever. However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump\\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been heavily criticized for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the longstanding friendship between Trump and White, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president\\u2019s blundered response to the outbreak. It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows. Euro-African promotion ARES FC postponed an upcoming event in Belgium. ONE Championship followed suit and postponed its 20 March show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after hosting its previous event in Singapore behind closed doors. Combate Americas announced a \\u201cproactive plan\\u201d that included postponing upcoming shows and scheduling new ones on a closed-set TV studio, while Bellator postponed its Friday show hours before the event was set to begin. Interestingly, White and the UFC have failed to address the status of UFC 249: Khabib v Ferguson, which is still scheduled to take place on April 18th at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. New York State governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York state last Saturday and has since placed a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city on Thursday and revealed that locations such as the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden could be closed for months to deal with what \\u201ccould easily be a six-month crisis.\\u201d While the UFC will likely move its anticipated pay-per-piew event from Brooklyn to the Apex facility, it remains to be seen whether that will serve as a long-term solution for the promotion, especially given that Nevada has also declared a state of emergency. White\\u2019s reaction to the outbreak over this past week, which includes the claim that he doesn\\u2019t \\u201cgive a shit about the coronavirus\\u201d, suggests that the UFC will continue to push ahead with their planned events irrespective of concerns regarding public safety. During a time of crisis, the UFC\\u2019s stubborn insistence that the show must go on is not only a prime example of corporate greed but a betrayal of its responsibility towards its staff, its fighters and the public at large. \\u201cThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector,\\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a media briefing declaring Covid-19 a pandemic. \\u201cSo every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 1044}, {\"title\": \"Send out paper ballots, Labour is urged after voting complaints\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/14/labour-party-ballot-papers-complaints-leadership-election\", \"content\": \"Labour is being urged to send ballot papers to all members who have not yet voted in its leadership election, after continuing complaints that some are still waiting for their chance to take part. MPs were contacting the party last week with concerns, with some members complaining of a \\u201cfarcical\\u201d situation in which they were having to provide high levels of proof of their identity before being granted a vote. Others said they simply had not received their email entitling them to vote in the online poll. Labour First, a group on the right of the party, surveyed its members earlier this month and found that 10% who responded had not received their electronic ballot paper. Another survey last week asked activists who had not received a ballot for details, and hundreds replied saying that they had had problems. Some members said they had been forced to ask their local council for proof that they were on the electoral roll after being denied a vote by the party. One MP said: \\u201cI\\u2019ve had loads of members getting in touch with problems, particularly about the electoral register. One who has been persistent in chasing the party has now been given the ballot, but it has required him to get proof from the local authority electoral services. My concern is that for every member who pursues it, there will be others who don\\u2019t bother and just don\\u2019t vote.\\u201d Another MP has also alerted the party to an issue affecting members who are under 18, who cannot use proof of their identity from the electoral register as they are not old enough to be on it. Anyone aged 14 or over can join the party. Other members said that they had received a ballot for the leadership election, but did not have one for an election for places on the party\\u2019s ruling national executive committee, which currently has a majority of members from Labour\\u2019s large left wing. Among those complaining are peers, MPs, party officers and councillors, all of whom were long-term members. However, party sources said that the independent company overseeing the ballot believed that it was seeing the level of voting it would expect at this point in the contest. Ballots close on 2 April, with the results announced on 4 April. Some members who have raised concerns said that they had been impressed with the speed at which Jennie Formby, the Labour general secretary, was responding to cases. Party sources said that there were no plans to send out paper ballots to those who had not voted, but Labour is planning to send three reminder emails to members, with the first going out on Monday. Luke Akehurst, secretary of Labour First, said: \\u201cWe are alarmed that there is clearly a glitch where a large number of members did not receive their NEC ballot, some new members are being ruled out on what appear to be spurious grounds, and \\u2013 for whatever reason \\u2013 approaching 10% of members say they haven\\u2019t received a ballot at all. The party is resending the NEC ballots, but turnout in this contest will clearly still be affected. We would call on the party to send a paper ballot now to everyone who hasn\\u2019t voted yet in case resending emails does not reach them. All these elections are crucial for Labour\\u2019s future. It is essential for their democratic legitimacy that every effort has been made to enable every member to vote.\\u201d Party sources said that its membership team was working through a plan to ensure that all members could vote and that there were no concerns about their capacity to look at the individual cases being raised. Members can ask for their ballot to be reissued through the party\\u2019s website, they said, while there was still plenty of time to cast a vote.

In such extraordinary times there just might have been the reassurance of waking up in the morning to news of an England batting collapse on foreign soil and everyone could conclude that all was well with the world. Life was going on as usual. But on Friday cricket bowed to the inevitable. Covid-19 has caused an upheaval to the schedules in a manner way beyond anything the terrorists have ever managed. England, following the lead of their rugby team at the height of the troubles in Ireland (\\u201cWe may not be very good but at least we turn up,\\u201d said the captain, John Pullin, at the post-match dinner in Dublin in 1972 after England had been soundly beaten), have often brazened it out when tours have been under threat. In India in 1984\\u201185 they stayed on despite the civil unrest following the assassination of Indira Gandhi; they travelled \\u2013 well, most of them did \\u2013 to India in 2001 and 2008 when there were security concerns, and also to Bangladesh in 2016. But the current threat is beyond the realm of Reg Dickson, the England and Wales Cricket Board\\u2019s cheerfully ubiquitous security officer. Like all of us the players must have been concerned they were now in uncharted territory. Sri Lanka is almost virus-free but the yearning to be alongside one\\u2019s family in such uncertain times is easy to understand. Moreover, the notion of playing in front of empty stadiums (even though that already happens too often in Test cricket, especially when England are not involved) is unpalatable. We are all losers here. Sri Lanka is a wonderful place to tour and in different circumstances there would have been thousands of England supporters there to enjoy the cricket and add to the atmosphere. Among the players, Matt Parkinson probably deserves more sympathy than any of the others. On his third tour of the winter there was just a chance that he would make his Test debut in Galle, where the ball always turns. But will there ever be another chance for him? Not next summer for a variety of reasons; just possibly next winter in India or indeed in Sri Lanka if the postponed tour is somehow rescheduled in between England\\u2019s already taxing commitments. Will he have to bounce grandchildren on his knee and explain to them wistfully the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for his career? Like every other sphere of life the immediate future of the game is shrouded with uncertainty, which may have been reflected by the words of Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB. \\u201cOur main priorities are to ensure we scope out the landscape for financial, logistical and scheduling implications.\\u201d That landscape is starting to look barren. The series against West Indies, due to begin at the Oval on 4 June, must be in deep jeopardy. I have heard the neat suggestion that the series could be played in the Caribbean instead (as I write Barbados has no cases of the virus and Antigua one) but why would any nation there welcome an influx of cricketers and supporters from the UK in the next few months? It is not going to happen, especially since on Saturday when the West Indies Board, acting on the advice of their medical advisory committee, suspended all its tournaments and face-to-face group meetings from Monday onwards for a minimum of 30 days. They are determined to act \\u201cwith an abundance of caution\\u201d. The series of white-ball fixtures against Australia must also be in doubt. These matches produce vital income, especially when the ECB\\u2019s emergency budget has been diminished. The second half of the summer should contain a three-Test series against Pakistan beginning on 30 July, followed by more one-day matches. The landscape in August and September also takes some scoping out. The uncertainty applies to domestic cricket as well. The T20 Blast, the most reliable source of revenue for the counties, is due to start on 29 May, when we are told that the virus is likely to be at its peak. Perhaps that competition will be shunted to the end of the season. Meanwhile, the Hundred is scheduled to begin on 18 July. There may be cynics out there who think I would welcome disruption to the Hundred, but this is not the case. Instead, my hunch is that the advocates of the Hundred \\u2013 like some ardent Brexiters \\u2013 will be quick to point out: \\u201cIt would have been a great success but for the virus.\\u201d Alternatively, if the Hundred is able to take place, sports fans might then be so desperate for some live action on their screens after being denied for so long that they might tune in in their millions. We are in straw\\u2011clutching territory. What of the championship? There is an argument, though it is unlikely to prevail, that a four-day match at the majority of venues would allow the spectators to self-isolate in the stands without any difficulty, although this would not be the case at Scarborough and occasionally at Taunton or Chelmsford, small grounds that often attract relatively large crowds. Nor would a championship match require too many resources that might be urgently needed elsewhere to oversee the event. Perhaps this is a fanciful notion but there could at least be a debate over the viability of allowing county cricket to continue, with those nervous of attending ending up watching the ever-improving streaming of matches.

As other dead cats disappear, it can only be a matter of time before Dominic Cumming\\u2019s blunderbuss is aimed at the marsh-dwelling myth of the will-o\\u2019-the-wisp, a small burning cloud of glowing methane, known for its leftwing sympathies, and responsible for curdling all the milk, souring all the cheese, and straightening all the bananas. Meanwhile, Turning Point UK, the British incarnation of a wealthy American rightwing youth organisation, endorsed by the child-friendly Conservative luminaries Priti Patel and Jacob Rees-Mogg, is aiming to compile a student snitches\\u2019 website listing the dangerous leftwing academics exposing our kids to their anti-racist mathematics and frayed corduroy jackets. This isn\\u2019t a new idea. When I was a leftwing student, I subsidised my full grant via a variety of jobs. I dressed as a monkey to leaflet for a fancy-dress shop, and was beaten soundly in the lane by hooligans to whom a boy dressed as a monkey for money, who just wanted to learn Anglo-Saxon poetry, was some kind of threat. And all through one beautiful and balmy Indian summer 33 years ago my lithe young body carried heavy suitcases up historic staircases for conference attendees at an Oxford college, a memory that now seems like a scene from an unwritten autobiographical novel which, like most autobiographical novels, has no need to exist. My favourite guests were the ghost hunters from the Society for Psychical Research. One of whom, a hugely likable man I now think must have been the renowned Tony Cornell, told me in the bar about his machine, the Spider (Spontaneous Psychical Incident Recorder), which he hoped would trap ghosts. I began to believe I had retroactively imagined the invention until, halfway through writing this sentence, I used the internet to verify the Spider\\u2019s existence, and catapulted myself back through time to haunt my own memories in smaller trousers. My least favourite conference attendees were the centre-right libertarians of the Freedom Association who, unlike the ghost hunters, didn\\u2019t tip me at all, seeing the practice as a socialist intervention in the marketplace. And they hadn\\u2019t invented any ghost-hunting machines with cool acronyms either. Founder member Norris McWhirter, who I knew as the boastful statistics goon from the BBC\\u2019s Record Breakers, had drawn napkin plans for a self-guided miniature vacuum cleaner, able to de-fluff the belly-buttons of freedom fighters whose attempts to discredit trade unions were hampered by distracting lint-clog. But Tony\\u2019s Spider was infinitely superior to the McWanc (McWhirter\\u2019s Automatic Navel Cleaner). In the evenings, wispy-haired McWhirter would hold forth to his followers in the bar. I couldn\\u2019t help but overhear the spindly statistician outlining his plans to get sympathetic scholars to help the Freedom Association compile a dossier of students involved with left-leaning causes, which could then be given to potential employers. Drunk and irked I sarcastically interrupted: \\u201cNorris. What is the biggest blacklist of left-leaning students that has ever been compiled and how long exactly was it?\\u201d McWhirter fixed me with his angry iron gaze, but couldn\\u2019t resist an arrogant display of knowledge. \\u201cThe biggest blacklist of left-leaning students that has ever been compiled is the one I am working on now and it is 43.6 centimetres long,\\u201d he declared, \\u201cBut I think it just got longer by the length of one name. And what is your name?\\u201d \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell him Lee,\\u201d piped up Tony from a corner, where he was compiling a dossier of fraudulent mediums to supply to potential ectoplasm. But it was too late. And two years later, my mysteriously rejected application to be the chairman of PricewaterhouseCoopers forced me instead into my standup comedy career. And the rest is history. Why don\\u2019t Policy Exchange, Turning Point UK, Toby Young\\u2019s X-Men of Shits, and the Freedom Association just set up their own universities, teaching climate-emergency denial, anti-trade union theory, progressive eugenics and political correctness gone mad? Universities are supposed to be leftwing, daddio! And so are students. If you can\\u2019t believe naively in the possibility of a better, fairer world as a 19-year-old, when can you? You will have the rest of your life to be an arse, and in the end self-interest and disillusion will make Conservative voters of the best of you. For example, though known today as a white Tory party grandee, in the 1950s Kenneth \\u201cKenny\\u201d Clarke was actually a black American jazz drummer, who pioneered the use of ride cymbals and irregular accents, and had an affair with Lenny Bruce\\u2019s ex, Annie Ross, before dying of heart failure in Pittsburgh in 1985. And if I hadn\\u2019t lived the charmed life of the standup comedian, clowning around in the same clothes and off-the-peg opinions I sported at 17, I could have been chopping out policies alongside Michael Gove, and campaigning to have my former self retroactively banned for speaking at any venues that receive public subsidy.

The Big Bang. The greenhouse effect. Metaphors are at the heart of scientific thinking. They provide the means for both scientists and non-scientists to understand, think through and talk about abstract ideas in terms of more familiar objects or phenomena. But if metaphors can illuminate, they can also constrain. In his new book, The Idea of the Brain, zoologist and historian Matthew Cobb tells the story of how scientists and philosophers have tried to understand the brain and how it works. In every age, Cobb shows, people have thought about the brain largely in terms of metaphors, drawn usually from the most exciting technology of the day, whether clocks or telephone exchanges or the contemporary obsession with computers. The brain, Cobb observes, \\u201cis more like a computer than like a clock\\u201d, but \\u201ceven the simplest animal brain is not a computer like anything we have built, nor one we can yet envisage\\u201d. Metaphors allow \\u201cinsight and discovery\\u201d but are \\u201cinevitably partial\\u201d and \\u201cthere will come a point when the understanding they allow will be outweighed by the limits they impose\\u201d. We may, Cobb suggests, be at that point in picturing the brain as a computer. The paradox of neuroscience today is that we possess an unprecedented amount of data about the brain but barely a glimmer of a theory to explain how it works. Indeed, as the French neuroscientist Yves Fr\\u00e9gnac has put it, making ample use of metaphor, it can feel as if \\u201cwe are drowning in a flood of information\\u201d and that \\u201call sense of global understanding [of brain function] is in acute danger of being washed away\\u201d. It\\u2019s not just in science that metaphors are significant in shaping the ways in which we think. In 1980, the linguist George Lakoff and philosopher Mark Johnson set off the modern debate on this issue with their seminal work, Metaphors We Live By. Metaphors, they argued, are not linguistic flourishes but the fundamental building blocks of thought. We don\\u2019t simply talk or write with metaphors, we also think with them. It\\u2019s a view fiercely contested by other psychologists and linguists. But even critics don\\u2019t deny the significance of metaphors. There is an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in which the Starship Enterprise encounters an alien race called the Tamarians who speak only in metaphors and allegories. The Earthlings find it very difficult to communicate. Humans are not Tamarians. Nevertheless, there are few areas of life in which metaphoric use is not deeply embedded. Some studies suggest that one word in every 25 we use is a metaphor. And there is much evidence that the choice of metaphor can shape the way we perceive the world and act upon it. In a series of experiments, two psychologists, Paul Thibodeau and Lera Boroditsky, gave participants one of two reports about crime in the fictional city of Addison. The reports were identical, except that in one crime was described as a \\u201cwild beast preying on the city\\u201d and in the other as a \\u201cvirus infecting the city\\u201d. When asked for solutions, those who read the first report suggested mostly tougher law enforcement and punishments, while those presented with the second were more willing to propose social reforms such as economic or healthcare improvements. Participants who identified as Republicans were 8-9% more likely to favour harsher punishment than Democrats. But the metaphor used made a difference twice as large \\u2013 18-22%. Metaphors, Thibodeau and Boroditsky observe, \\u201chave profound influences on how we conceptualise and act with respect to important societal issues\\u201d. Social and political discussions are steeped in metaphors from \\u201ctrickle-down economics\\u201d to the \\u201cred wall\\u201d. They help frame the issues, and hence our responses, too. When politicians compare the national economy to a household budget, they are pushing us to think in particular ways about national debt or policies of austerity. Similarly, when politicians talk of \\u201cswarms\\u201d of migrants or describe countries as \\u201cshields\\u201d against them, the language aims to elicit particular public responses. The coronavirus is both a physical threat and a metaphor for everything from the failures of globalisation to the menace of foreigners. The role that metaphors play in science and politics is subtly different. Many scientists accept that metaphors can be limiting, but insist, too, that they are an essential tool for thinking. In political and social debates, metaphors are primarily ways of framing issues, and of shaping the ways in which people think about them. Metaphors can expand our vision and provide insights denied to more literal thinking. But, whether in science or in politics, we need to pay greater attention to the metaphors we wield. \\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 16, \"content_len\": 780}, {\"title\": \"Pay, not cleaning, is the problem | Letters\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/observer-letters-pay-not-cleaning-the-problem\", \"content\": \"Why is it exploitative to hire someone to clean the home (\\u201cI\\u2019m a feminist but I hired a cleaner\\u201d, Focus), which is traditional women\\u2019s work, but OK to hire someone to do traditional men\\u2019s work \\u2013 mowing the lawn, cleaning the car, replacing roof tiles, house painting etc?

Tom Allan Liverpool Electric cars not the answer We cannot prevent climate change by adopting electric cars (\\u201cFirms plan for \\u00a312bn electric vehicle switch\\u201d, News). The car will still be built of steel and each tonne of steel produced generates around two tonnes of carbon dioxide. Global production of steel currently runs at about 1.8bn tonnes per annum. It will still require road infrastructure, much of which requires concrete. Each tonne of cement produced generates more than a tonne of carbon dioxide. Global cement production is currently around 4bn tonnes per annum. Steel and cement production account of around 20% of global CO2 emissions. Transport accounts for a further 25%. The production of rechargeable electric vehicles requires millions of tonnes of lithium. The greatest deposits of lithium are in Argentina, Bolivia and Chile. Lithium is now being called \\u201cwhite oil\\u201d and one suspects it will do to Argentina, Bolivia and Chile what oil has done to the Middle East, that is, distort economies and disrupt politics.

There have been 91 deaths, and France is one of several countries across Europe that have gone into lockdown. Schools closed after final lessons last week, meaning 12.4 million students will remain at home, where the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has warned they will be expected to follow the national curriculum syllabus online.

Kim Willsher China The number of imported coronavirus cases now exceeds locally transmitted new infections for the first time, data from China\\u2019s national health commission shows. On Friday it had 11 new cases, but seven were brought in by travellers from the US, Italy and Saudi Arabia, and only four were transmitted inside the country. At least one of these was a US-based Chinese citizen, who reportedly returned home in search of medical treatment after requests for a test were turned down in Massachusetts, where she lived. Beijing has been providing free treatment as part of its effort to halt the spread of the virus. But apparently in anticipation of more people arriving from abroad with the disease, it has drawn up a policy that will require most to pay for their own care. Emma Graham-Harrison Spain The Spanish government declared a state of emergency on Saturday, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to leave their homes only if they needed to buy food, medicine, or go to work or hospital. The lockdown comes after schools across the country were closed for a fortnight and the regional governments of Madrid, Murcia, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias ordered the closure of all non-essential shops. The only businesses permitted to remain open are supermarkets, bakeries, butchers, fishmongers, greengrocers, petrol stations, pharmacies, tobacconists and newspaper kiosks. Madrid\\u2019s city council announced the closure of all public parks and gardens to prevent large concentrations of people, while Seville, Granada and C\\u00f3rdoba cancelled their Holy Week celebrations. The Catalan president, Quim Torra, announced plans to close off the north-eastern region and called on the central government to assist by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways. After Italy, Spain is the European country most affected by the coronavirus, and has confirmed 6,391 cases and 196 deaths. Jet2, which flies from nine UK airports to destinations including Alicante, M\\u00e1laga and Lanzarote, said it was cancelling all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. The socialist-led government of prime minister Pedro S\\u00e1nchez, whose wife tested positive for Covid-19 last night, has been fiercely criticised for its delay in rolling out robust measures to fight the virus and for allowing huge rallies across the country last Sunday to mark International Women\\u2019s Day. A state of emergency has not been declared since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\\u2019 strike. It will initially apply for two weeks. Sam Jones India Fears are growing about the spread of the virus in the world\\u2019s second-most populous country after it recorded its second death. India has an impressive record in tackling infectious diseases, including defeating polio, and in 2009 curbing the swine flu pandemic. But it also has a stretched and uneven public health system. The latest victim, a 68-year-old woman, caught the virus from her son after he travelled to Italy and Switzerland. He works at a large plant and may have been in contact with up to 1,500 people. With 102 cases confirmed, the New Delhi government has invoked the Epidemic Act, which allows authorities to force people into isolation, and has brought in laws to prevent hoarding of hand sanitisers. In many states, social life is being curbed, with gyms, pools, cinemas and theatres closed, and weddings, engagements and birthday parties banned in southern Karnataka.

Ministers are also not ruling out ordering the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Such drastic measures would go beyond what the government anticipated in its coronavirus action plan, but countries such as France have ordered closures on this scale and Hancock said the government would do whatever was necessary to protect life. Hancock confirmed the government will soon tell people over 70 that they will need to self-isolate at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the disease \\u2013 but his terminology caused some confusion, leading Scottish officials to stress that elderly people would not be asked to avoid all contact with other people. In an interview on the BBC\\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Hancock said asking the over-70s to stay self-isolated would be \\u201ca very big ask\\u201d, but that it was part of the government\\u2019s action plan because it would be necessary to protect them. He said this would be announced in the coming weeks. Jason Leitch, the national clinical director for the Scottish government, which is working with the Westminster government on a UK-wide coronavirus strategy, subsequently said on Twitter there was no plan to ask the over-70s to \\u201ccompletely socially isolate\\u201d and that the proposal for older people would be to minimise social contact, not end it. In a tweet, he said: \\u201cWe are working on guidance for the over-70s to be asked to REDUCE social contact for their safety. So no bingo, no pubs \\u2026 BUT family visits and neighbours etc.\\u201d The term self-isolation has been used by health officials to refer to the very strict isolation routine supposed to be followed by people with coronavirus, but on Sunday morning Hancock seemed to be using it in the looser sense that has become commonplace \\u2013 referring to staying at home and minimising social interaction. The health department said guidelines saying exactly what the new advice for the over-70s would mean in practice would be published in due course. In the Marr interview, Hancock was asked if the government would follow countries such as France and Spain, where bars, restaurants and shops have been closed, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies. Hancock replied: \\u201cWe have not ruled that out. We will do what is necessary. Because the top priority is to protect life, and you do that by protecting the vulnerable, and by protecting the NHS. That is the goal.\\u201d Asked about the state of the NHS, Hancock said hospitals would need more beds and that one solution would be to cancel operations and to convert operating theatres used for non-urgent procedures such as knee operations into wards for coronavirus patients. Operating theatres were suitable because they had oxygen supplies, he said. He also said he was looking at converting hotels, \\u201cmany of which are currently empty\\u201d, into temporary hospitals. And he said the government would be urging manufacturers to produce more ventilators. He said the NHS already had about 5,000 ventilators, which were needed for people who get severely ill through coronavirus, but he said the country needed \\u201cmany times more than that\\u201d. He said that, although they were complicated pieces of machinery, they were not so complex that it was impossible for advanced manufacturers to switch to producing them, and he said that in a conference call, scheduled for Monday, Boris Johnson would be urging manufacturing companies to do just this. \\u201cWe are saying: you produce a ventilator, then we will buy it. No number is too high,\\u201d Hancock said. \\u201cThe prime minister is hosting a conference call \\u2026 to say very clearly to the nation\\u2019s manufacturers: ventilators are the thing that we are going to need, and frankly, right across the world, the demand for them is incredibly high, so it is not possible to produce too many. So anybody who can should turn production and their engineering minds over to the production of ventilators.\\u201d Cobra, the government\\u2019s emergency committee, will meet again on Monday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, and on Tuesday the government will announce details of the emergency legislation it plans to pass to give it new powers it may need as the crisis escalate, Hancock said. He said the bill had been amended to take in suggestions made by the Labour party, and that it would be published on Thursday. It is due to go through the Commons the following week. Among other provisions, the bill will give the government the power to quarantine people deemed a threat to public health, Hancock said. He added: \\u201cI doubt that actually we will need to use it much, because people are being very responsible.\\u201d Hancock also confirmed the government may ban gatherings of more than 500 people \\u2013 a move that is already being introduced in Scotland from Monday. In recent days, the government has faced growing criticism for not matching some of the more stringent public health measures taken in other European countries, where schools have been closed, public gatherings banned and entry restrictions imposed. Hancock defended the UK\\u2019s response. He said it was doing more coronavirus testing than in any country apart from China, South Korea, and Italy, where the outbreak has been more severe. And he rejected claims that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere. \\u201cWe are similar to many countries,\\u201d he claimed. \\u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others. \\u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.\\u201d He said that \\u201cin the coming days\\u201d the government would publish details of the modelling it was using when determining its policy. He also said he was confident food supplies would continue. He was also relatively dismissive of an open letter signed by more than 300 scientists from UK universities criticising the government\\u2019s approach. In the letter, the group, most of whom are not epidemiologists but instead specialists in subjects like maths, call for \\u201csocial distancing\\u201d measures to be introduced immediately, and argue that aiming for \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d is not viable. Asked about the letter, Hancock said: \\u201cWhat we will do is listen to all the credible scientists. What we will not do is deviate from having a plan that is based on the best scientific advice.\\u201d Hancock also argued that the letter was misstating government policy in suggesting that it wanted to build up herd immunity to coronavirus among the population at large. \\u201cHerd immunity is not our goal or policy, it\\u2019s a scientific concept\\u201d, he said. \\u201cOur policy is to protect lives and to beat this virus.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 1156}, {\"title\": \"Death Row Guard Has Always Had Soft Spot For The Innocent Ones\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/death-row-guard-has-always-had-soft-spot-for-the-innoce-1819576887?utm_campaign=SF&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_source=Twitter&utm_content=Main\", \"content\": \"Saying he\\u2019s seen \\u201ca lot of people come through here in [his] day\\u201d and met prisoners of every type, longtime Louisiana State Penitentiary death row guard Dwayne McFadden confided Wednesday that he\\u2019s always had a bit of a soft spot for the innocent ones.\", \"fake\": \"1\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 44}, {\"title\": \"Report Confirms That Being Unable To Keep Track Of Mass Shootings Technically Counts As Not Giving Attention To Shooters\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/report-confirms-that-being-unable-to-keep-track-of-mass-1839946465\", \"content\": \"Stressing that it was by no means an ideal solution to the issue, a report released Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that an inability to keep track of all the nation\\u2019s mass shootings still counts as denying shooters the attention they crave. \\u201cWith the sheer number of massacres occurring across the United States, our failure to focus long on any individual attacker has, in its own way, prevented these killers from gaining notoriety,\\u201d said comparative media scholar and report co-author William Uricchio, adding that the average citizen\\u2019s capacity to remember discrete instances of mass murder reached a saturation point around 2013, and since then no single rampaging gunman stands out much from the others like him. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve seen a remarkable decrease in the public awareness of a given shooter\\u2019s name, his motives, and the ideology he subscribes to\\u2014as well as the fact that his attack took place at all.

Industry sources indicated that it appears likely the problem could be replicated in other sectors. In a letter sent to publicans last week, which has been seen by the Guardian, Ei said: \\u201cIt has been confirmed that Zurich is not including Covid-19 in its notifiable diseases section. As such, any business affected by Covid-19 will not be able to claim for loss of trade.\\u201d The move comes after many small-business owners had thought a problem with making insurance claims for coronavirus losses had been solved. Earlier this month, the government bowed to pressure by changing its stance on insurance to declare coronavirus as a \\u201cnotifiable disease\\u201d \\u2013 a formal classification required by many insurance policies. However, many of these existing policies cite specific diseases that businesses can claim for. As coronavirus is so new, it is not included in most of the lists. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said: \\u201cA small number of businesses may have cover in place that will specifically provide for business interruption arising from notifiable diseases. However, this type of extension is not commonly included as standard. Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks and are therefore unlikely to provide cover for the effects of global pandemics like Covid-19.\\u201d Viv English, who runs the Lansdown Arms in Lewes, Sussex, said: \\u201cWe have no Premier League games and maybe a 20% to 30% hit on trade.

Exclusive analysis for the Guardian published last month revealed that Airbnb has become so prevalent across Britain that some parts of the country have one listing for every four properties, with the highest incidence in Edinburgh old town, bolstering concerns that short-term lets are depriving communities of much-needed homes. The online tracking tool to chart the scale of short-term lets available across Scotland was launched by the Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman in January, and allows people to report properties in their local area that are operating as commercial lets. In early figures seen by the Guardian, of the 359 commercial short-term lets recorded so far, only one has planning consent according to information publicly available from Edinburgh city council. The council\\u2019s position is that commercial short-term letting is a material change of use requiring planning permission. If these results were replicated across Scotland, that would suggest 99.7% of short-term lets in Scotland could be unlawful. Wightman, whose campaigning work on short-term lets was prompted by stories of individual distress and disrupted communities from his Edinburgh constituents, notes that there are 480 listings for Edinburgh on the website of public agency VisitScotland. The Lothian region MSP, who has led on the issue, said: \\u201cThis early picture from my Homes First site reveals the depressing truth of how out of control this sector is. All but one of the properties identified so far have no planning consent to be a short-term let. Any property that should have planning consent but does not is unlawful. \\u201cWhile proposed new licensing powers are welcome, they will not be of much use if owners are so willing to flout planning laws. The Scottish government\\u2019s commitment to regulation is further undermined by the fact that Visit Scotland, which has a strategic partnership with Airbnb, is actively promoting holiday accommodation that is unlawful despite encouraging visitors to book only licensed and regulated accommodation. Scottish ministers should ask their own tourism agency to stop advertising unlawful businesses.\\u201d In January, as a direct response to concerns raised by local residents of popular tourist destinations, the Scottish government announced councils would be given new powers to introduce licensing schemes for short-term lets from 2021. Neil Gardiner, planning convener for Edinburgh city council, said: \\u201cWe\\u2019ll always use the existing powers we have through planning enforcement to investigate cases reported to us as we are very clear that we want properties unlawfully taken out of housing supply to be returned to being people\\u2019s homes. \\u201cThis is very resource-intensive though and we\\u2019re continuing to proactively work with the Scottish government to introduce a licensing regime which will give us far greater control over the sector in the future.

The journey was undertaken to support Palace for Life Foundation, the club\\u2019s official charity that works with vulnerable young people in south London. The 28 riders, who have raised almost \\u00a315,000 so far, were undeterred when they found out the game had been postponed, carrying on regardless.

The game was officially postponed just before lunchtime. Stephen Kingdom, who during a previous season cycled to every away game, said: \\u201cIt was a bit different getting here and not having a game on, the last time I cycled here we won 2-0. When we heard it was off, we had a quick discussion but we all decided we\\u2019d still do it and support the foundation.\\u201d The final leg of the journey, 40 miles through the New Forest, was completed on Saturday, with the group arriving at Bournemouth\\u2019s unusually quiet ground at lunchtime. Security staff opened the ground and allowed the riders to head pitchside, taking in the empty stands and posing for photos in the dugout. Mike Summers, the chief executive of Palace for Life, said: \\u201cConsidering everything that\\u2019s gone on this week, there were times we didn\\u2019t think this ride was going to go ahead, but it just shows the power of the Palace fanbase; they\\u2019ve all been fantastic throughout. \\u201cIt was a mixed feeling arriving at the Vitality Stadium.

At least 97 foreign nationals who visited Egypt since mid-February showed symptoms or tested positive for Covid-19 on return home, according to public health data and news reports. Most spent time on Nile cruises believed to be the source of the outbreak in the southern city of Luxor, a tourism hotspot. Egyptian officials say that an additional 100 foreign nationals and Egyptians have tested positive for the coronavirus since mid-February. This includes a 60-year-old woman declared dead on Thursday in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, 465 miles from Luxor. Her death, the first of an Egyptian citizen during the current epidemic, came a week after officials removed 45 passengers from the Asara cruise ship later quarantined in Luxor. Some 82 passengers left quarantine on board the ship and travelled home just days later, after officials from Egypt\\u2019s ministry of health flew to Luxor to screen 558 more people \\u2013 all tested negative. A further 27 people initially diagnosed with the virus retested negative, they added. Tourism is a cornerstone of Egypt\\u2019s economy, and officials insisted on business as usual, stressing that tourist sites in Luxor remain open even as the country banned large public gatherings and closed schools. The Egyptian military announced new measures, including using the chemical weapons department to help with testing. But observers fear Egypt\\u2019s emergency measures may have begun too late, following limited testing, a tight grip on infection statistics and outbreak locations and potential legal action against anyone seen to be \\u201cspreading false news or rumours\\u201d, about the disease. \\u201cWe announce everything with complete transparency,\\u201d said Egypt\\u2019s prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly. Yet Taiwan\\u2019s Centre for Disease Control disproved statements by Egypt\\u2019s ministry of health that a Taiwanese woman on board the Asara cruise was the source of the infection in Luxor in late February. Instead, they said, analyses proved that the strain of the virus she contracted meant she was infected in Egypt. Infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto who studied the disparity between official and likely infection rates in places like Iran provided a grim picture of the possible spread of the virus in Egypt. \\u201cUnder the conservative estimate of Covid-2019 burden, where linked and ambiguous cases are eliminated, we estimated an outbreak size of 19,310 cases in Egypt,\\u201d they said, using a mix of flight data, traveller data and infection rates. \\u201cEgypt likely has a large burden of Covid-2019 cases that are unreported and greater public health clinical capacity may help identify and manage cases.\\u201d The scientists used data from early March when Egypt officially had three cases of the virus, meaning the numbers are now likely higher. Khaled Megahead, the spokesman for Egypt\\u2019s ministry of health, did not respond to requests for comment. Egypt has an overwhelmingly young population, meaning that fewer people will display serious symptoms of Covid-19. Many say privately they would opt to self-isolate if they contracted the virus, reluctant to surrender to a government that has quarantined people in a remote area close to the Libyan border, and detained doctors in the past. \\u201cSo far the testing process is very central. It is based on the scenario of if someone suspects that he is sick, he goes to certain places,\\u201d said a doctor at one hospital in Matariya, who asked not to be named. Two doctors in Luxor dismissed the idea they could have overlooked cases, despite tourists leaving the city and reporting symptoms on returning home. \\u201cThere is no country in the world that can test the entire population,\\u201d said one, who screened passengers on the Asara last Friday and gave his name only as Bakry. Yet examples worldwide show that widespread testing is essential to understanding and fighting the highly contagious virus. \\u201cThere are specific symptoms and guidelines about how many and whom we have to test,\\u201d he said, adding that nine further cruise ships were tested on 6 March alongside the Asara. A German tourist on board the Hapi 5 Nile cruiser who was transported from Luxor to Hurghada hospital that day died two days later. Other passengers quarantined on board tested negative, and the cruise continued. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t see people coming to the hospitals with symptoms. It doesn\\u2019t look like China, where people are falling down in the street,\\u201d said Islam Asery, a surgeon at Luxor International hospital. He stressed that he found official figures credible, and viewed honesty as a patriotic act. Still, he said, \\u201cSharing information is sometimes seen as political because it\\u2019s attached to income coming from tourism. Our government and all of us dealing with this are being careful.\\u201d Sherbiny, a hotel worker in Luxor, said officials arrived at his place of work at 6am on 9 March for tests. \\u201cThe medical team entered with full protective gear and masks and took blood samples,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut they were accompanied by plain-clothed policemen,\\u201d he added, meaning that security officials who often move about the city remained unprotected. Egypt has a population of 100 million people, where 95% live on roughly 5% of the land, a challenge for practising social distancing. The government has taken steps to handle the problem, including shortening prayer times and announcing a \\u00a35.2bn fund to combat the \\u201cconsequences of the virus\\u201d. But it has also sought to control the narrative, even as nearby countries banned entry from Egypt. Doctors and pharmacists who spoke with the Guardian doubted that Egypt\\u2019s public healthcare system is prepared for the impact of Covid-19. Pharmacists, often many Egyptians\\u2019 first choice for medical advice, said many fear being diagnosed. \\u201cI saw a couple of cases, where people come with cold symptoms, and they are afraid to say that they suspect it\\u2019s coronavirus,\\u201d said one operating in Cairo who declined to give his name. \\u201cSince there is no manual or information from the authorities on what to do if you are around someone with symptoms, lots of people just take doses of antibiotics, so they are stable for a couple of days.

Instead the programme is about the things we recognise, but perhaps haven\\u2019t acknowledged, in cinema; the recurrent stories, themes and tropes that underlie the movies we love. From the outset, Kim Newman\\u2019s involvement as lead writer on Secrets of Cinema was crucial. His knowledge of movies is encyclopaedic. I met him when I was first working as a film critic in London in the 1980s, and we have a shared interest in narrative \\u2013 in the way movies tell stories. Along with director Nick Freand Jones, producer John Das and archivist Jane Long, we\\u2019d sit in Newman\\u2019s London flat brainstorming each programme, and the scripts came out of the notes of those fantastically enjoyable meetings. I think it was that sense of excitement that spurred the positive response to the first series, which covered romcoms, heist movies, sci-fi, horror and coming-of-age pictures. Since then we\\u2019ve made three one-off specials, and now the new series, which covers superheroes, British history and spies. Here\\u2019s some of our favourite \\u201csecrets\\u201d, culled from those programmes\\u2026 MK Monster movies can be romcoms too Film genres are slippery, with cross-pollination and mutation the order of the day. A film can look like one thing from the outside \\u2013 be it a drama, thriller, horror or comedy \\u2013 but delve beneath the surface and you\\u2019ll find a rich cocktail of movie-genre DNA. Take The Shape of Water, which won the Oscar for best picture in 2018. On the surface, it looks like a science-fiction/horror hybrid in the style of Creature from the Black Lagoon \\u2013 the 3D monster-movie from 1954. Yet The Shape of Water also features a musical fantasy sequence, inspired by the monochrome designs and dances of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film Follow the Fleet (1936). And with its central tale of a love affair between a woman and what it basically a merman, it bears an uncanny similarity to Ron Howard\\u2019s Splash (1984), a classic romcom posing as a fairytale fantasy. You can find the romcom gene in a host of movie genres, from Bollywood musical melodramas to Hollywood superhero spectaculars (see below). Japanese director Takashi Miike\\u2019s Audition (1999), adapted from the novel by Ryu Murakami, starts out like an off-kilter romcom before mutating into a terrifying symphony of pain and piano wire. As for David Cronenberg\\u2019s 1986 remake of the 1958 shocker The Fly, its plot is essentially a twisted variation on an old romcom favourite: boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy has accident with a teleporter and splices himself with an insect before getting girl to shoot him in the head. Ah, sweet! How to win an Oscar The most often repeated canard about the Oscars is that the easiest path to an acting statuette is to play a character with mental health issues (see Tropic Thunder). Best-picture winners focusing on mental-health issues include The Lost Weekend, Rain Man, Forrest Gump and A Beautiful Mind. Even One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\u2019s Nest and The Silence of the Lambs, which won several awards (including gongs for both leading actors), are about patients under psychiatric care. This year, Joaquin Phoenix took best actor for Joker, playing a supervillain with a range of complexes and compulsions. But Oscar also loves British royalty, all the way back to Charles Laughton\\u2019s Henry VIII, with crowned-head awards on the shelves of Helen Mirren (The Queen), Judi Dench (Shakespeare in Love), Katharine Hepburn (The Lion in Winter) and more. The glow of privilege even falls upon common prime ministers, with George Arliss, Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman taking top acting honours as Disraeli, Thatcher and Churchill respectively. Thus, the most obvious Oscar lock-in in cinema history was Colin Firth in The King\\u2019s Speech, playing a royal underdog struggling against hidebound courtiers (award-winning screen royals all have to be rebellious) while simultaneously overcoming a handicap (his stutter). Firth had the statuette on his mantelpiece from the first time he opened the script \\u2013 it\\u2019s a wonder the other nominees even bothered to show up. British history is best seen from a distance History is the quintessential British film genre. America may have the great outdoors for westerns and road movies, and teeming cities for cop and crime sagas. But Britain has seen off the Romans, been ruled by Tudors and Stuarts, built and then lost an empire, and fought all the way through two world wars. Unsurprisingly, British history films have proved a highly exportable film commodity \\u2013 yet it\\u2019s notable that many of the best movies in this genre were made by film-makers from other countries. The first British talkie to make significant inroads into the American market was The Private Life of Henry VIII in 1933. Charles Laughton won a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of the gluttonous monarch, famously tearing into chicken with his bare hands, and running through wives the way he ran through numerous multi-course feasts. Fast forward to 2019, and Olivia Colman won a best actress Oscar for her portrayal of the emotionally damaged Queen Anne in The Favourite. Both of these films (which are fondly imagined as very \\u201cBritish\\u201d triumphs) had \\u201cforeign\\u201d directors; the Hungarian Alexander Korda and the Greek Yorgos Lanthimos respectively. Both also play fast and loose with history (as does everything from Hammer\\u2019s oft-forgotten 1967 romp The Viking Queen, which is actually set in Roman times, to Mel Gibson\\u2019s 1996 best picture winner Braveheart, an American production, set in Scotland, shot in Ireland, directed by and starring an Irish-American-Australian). Meanwhile, despite its bizarre mashup of glam-rock costumes and 1970s sex comedy tropes, Italian Pier Paolo Pasolini\\u2019s The Canterbury Tales (1972) evoked Chaucer with zest and earthiness, making it one of the few films about medieval Britain that an actual medieval audience might recognise. Perhaps true Britishness \\u2013 or at least the version of it that sells to an international audience \\u2013 can only really be observed from the outside. Bond movies owe a huge debt to Alfred Hitchcock The spy genre has its roots in such 1920s Fritz Lang movies as the Dr Mabuse series and Spies (1928), which drew on the earlier French thriller serials of Louis Feuillade. But Alfred Hitchcock dominated the origins of the \\u201cspy film\\u201d with such prewar British thrillers as The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938). A succession of sophisticated Hollywood movies established Hitchcock as the maestro of mistrust and suspense, reaching its apotheosis in North By Northwest (1959) in which Cary Grant\\u2019s ad man Roger Thornhill is mistaken for a government agent. Hitchcock\\u2019s influence on the look and feel of the action is critical; Sean Connery said that the early Bond films would have looked very different without North By Northwest. The famous crop-duster scene clearly influenced the helicopter attack in From Russia With Love \\u2013 and Eva Marie Saint\\u2019s role as the villain\\u2019s girlfriend who defects to side with Grant prefigures Pussy Galore from Goldfinger and many another Bond girl. Before disaster movies, we had disaster theatre Since the days of the earliest biblical epics, audiences have revelled in seeing temples crumble, worlds shake, ships sink and towers fall. From the fire-and-brimstone biblical epics of early cinema to the boom years of the 1970s in which the US producer Irwin Allen became the \\u201cmaster of disaster\\u201d, spectacular destruction has been a saleable movie mainstay. Like horror films, disaster movies often work as modern morality tales; reminding us of the natural order of things by terrifying us with visions of chaos and apocalypse. But although the visceral thrills of disaster epics such as James Cameron\\u2019s Titanic (one of the most successful movies of all time) may seem unique to cinema, they are in fact rooted in a popular form of Victorian theatre which featured sunken ships, onstage pyrotechnics and drowning extras aplenty. Indeed, one of the earliest surviving fragments of film, shot at the London Hippodrome in 1902, captured the finale of Bandits \\u2013 an action-packed theatre show in which a mill explodes into flames and, in the ensuing flood, a bridge collapses and speeding horses plunge into a millpond. This kind of theatrical spectacle was a sensational crowd-pleasing draw, along with re-enactments of famous sea battles and infamous wrecks \\u2013 the more realistic the better. You can draw a direct line from these stage productions to such silent-era films as Cecil B DeMille\\u2019s The Ten Commandments (1923) and Fred Niblo\\u2019s Ben-Hur (1925), the latter having been staged in London and New York in the late 19th century, complete with chariots pulled by live horses, charging on treadmills! The secret of a successful superhero movie is to make one that women will want to see Comic-book-derived superhero films are the reigning genre of spectacular cinema. But decades-old Marvel or DC properties can\\u2019t click as big-screen franchises unless they can manage crossover appeal beyond 13-year-old male comics fans. This core constituency might be vocal online about whether Spider-Man\\u2019s webs should squirt from wrist-gadgets or be organic secretions, but there aren\\u2019t enough of them to record box-office numbers in the billions. As far back as Superman (1978), film-makers have balanced super-heroics with elements calculated to appeal to female viewers \\u2013 casting male eye-candy leads from Christopher Reeve and Chris Hemsworth to Chadwick Boseman and Jason Momoa in costumes every bit as objectifying as a Bond girl\\u2019s negligee. They\\u2019ve also baked romcom (or soap opera) elements into most broad-appeal super-sagas, from the 1940s-style newsroom banter between Reeve\\u2019s Clark Kent and Margot Kidder\\u2019s Lois Lane, through the kinkier 30 Shades of Black Leather sparks between Michael Keaton\\u2019s Batman and Michelle Pfeiffer\\u2019s Catwoman, to the sweet teen romances that all three big-screen incarnations of Peter Parker have with appealing, distinctive relatable female leads (Kirsten Dunst, Emma Stone, Zendaya). Avengers: Endgame features a huge battle in the climax, but sent audiences home with an unashamed (if bittersweet) romantic happy ending. For a perfect example of not understanding the rules, consider Zack Snyder\\u2019s run of DC films \\u2013 Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Justice League \\u2013 which drown in earnest, fan-servicing bombast, but flare into life only when Gal Gadot\\u2019s Wonder Woman forces her way on screen and demands attention. Charles Dickens invented the Christmas movie There\\u2019s a theory, dramatised in the 2017 biopic The Man Who Invented Christmas, that Charles Dickens \\u2013 inspired perhaps by Prince Albert, who imported many German Yuletide traditions to Victorian Britain \\u2013 is more responsible than anyone else for the way we still celebrate Christmas. A Christmas Carol, published in 1843, has been filmed more often than almost any other novel, including modern-dress takes like Hammer\\u2019s enormously underrated 1961 Cash on Demand (Peter Cushing\\u2019s Scrooge-like bank manager mends his ways after he\\u2019s tormented by genial hold-up man Andr\\u00e9 Morell) and pantomime charades like The Muppet Christmas Carol (1992). Its storyline, characters and underlying message have seeped into a wealth of apparently unrelated films set over the holidays. If there is such a genre as the Christmas film, then they\\u2019re all essentially adaptations of A Christmas Carol, in which a despairing, Christmas-hating grouch (or Grinch) suffers amid jollity (the contrast of misery with tinsel and carols is always poignant) and finally comes to appreciate hearth and home (stressed far more often in Christmas films than Christianity \\u2013 Santa Claus is a bigger presence than baby Jesus in these movies). Frank Capra\\u2019s It\\u2019s a Wonderful Life (1946), in which George Bailey (James Stewart) is visited by an angel rather than three ghosts and (yes) John McTiernan\\u2019s Die Hard (1988), in which John McClane (Bruce Willis) literally fights terrorists in order to get his wife Holly (!) home for present\\u2011opening and eggnog, both fit the pattern set down by Ebeneezer Scrooge, the spectral visitors, and the happy-despite-all-their-woes Cratchits. Horror movies only scare if we care To a casual observer, a horror film just needs the scariest monster imaginable. Fans debate whether Dracula is more evil than Michael Myers (the masked killer from Halloween) or who ought to win in King Kong vs Godzilla (Kong controversially won the 1964 bout on points, but a new version is being made). Studios hire makeup-effects geniuses to transform character actors, stunt men or masses of pixels into supernatural killing machines. But that\\u2019s not enough. The job of a horror film is to be frightening, and to be frightened an audience has to enter the world of the movie \\u2013 invest emotionally in people who will be (at the very least) seriously inconvenienced when werewolves besiege the ranch or an X from Outer Space eats the police station. The crucial segments of great horror films are the \\u201cnormal\\u201d scenes that come before the monster attacks \\u2013 the rapport between the teenagers in John Carpenter\\u2019s Halloween (1978), the dynamics of the struggling family in Bong Joon-ho\\u2019s The Host (2006), the all-too-credible escape from the controlling boyfriend who isn\\u2019t yet a full-on movie monster at the beginning of the latest reboot of The Invisible Man (2020). Genre aficionado Rob Zombie, who remade Halloween in 2007, is an imaginative film-maker who has never had a mainstream hit because he\\u2019s obsessed with monsters who can be merchandised as action figures, but has zero interest in (and, in fact, contempt for) the people they kill. In coming-of-age movies, pop music is a memory When director Richard Brooks slapped the Bill Haley B-side Rock Around the Clock over the opening credits of Blackboard Jungle (1955) to give his film a contemporary edge, the result was incendiary. Teen audiences were reported to be dancing in the aisles and even slashing cinema seats, overcome by the excitement of hearing such up-to-the-minute sounds blaring out of the large speakers of their local cinemas. Yet by the time that same song reappeared \\u2013 again over the opening credits \\u2013 in George Lucas\\u2019s coming-of-age classic American Graffiti (1973), it had entirely lost its element of edgy threat. Instead, it had become an integral part of a nostalgic patchwork of jukebox hits used to evoke a lost age of innocence \\u2013 a musical time-machine transporting the viewer back to a bygone era. While pop music is still used to lend a cutting edge to some teen-oriented releases, its main function in contemporary coming-of-age movies is more likely to have a retrospective edge. Think about the 2017 best picture winner Moonlight: in one of the film\\u2019s most memorable scenes, director Barry Jenkins very specifically places Barbara Lewis\\u2019s melancholy hit Hello Stranger on a diner jukebox in a scene that could have come straight out of American Graffiti. Through the sound of that song, our protagonists are returned to their younger selves, rekindling the love they had before adulthood changed everything. As film producer Steve Woolley once observed: \\u201cPop music in movies is like a knife \\u2013 you twist it and nostalgia comes pouring out.\\u201d In a heist movie, after the meticulously worked-out plan is put into action, there has to be a hiccup at the end of the second act... This also works for putting-on-a-show musicals, men-on-a-mission war films and losers-turn-it-around movies \\u2013 suggesting a mythic template underlies apparently disparate genres. The pleasure of these stories is that a problem is posed \\u2013 a bank that can\\u2019t be robbed, a jewel behind the most elaborate security system in the world, a casino run by gangsters who\\u2019ll kill anyone who tries to rob them \\u2013 that can only be solved by a range of specialists who might not naturally work together. A key scene \\u2013 paralleled by the first rehearsal, mission briefing or locker room strategising in the related genres \\u2013 has the master planner (producer, commanding officer, coach) explain on a blackboard, or using a model, exactly how the trick will be pulled off. As the military maxim has it, no plan survives first contact with the enemy. At a crucial point, usually toward the end of the second act, a random factor has to be thrown-in \\u2013 a changed password, an unexpected double-cross, a star who breaks her ankle so an understudy has to step up \\u2013 forcing our heroes to ditch some element of their meticulous pre-planning and just wing it. Heist movies sub-divide into breezy romps and gritty noirs. In the former, Danny Ocean or some similar suave modern-day Robin Hood improvises his way out of trouble and dances off with the loot. In the latter, thieves fall out, or deadly fate gets in the way, and the joke\\u2019s on the dead guys who dreamed they could get away with it.

Most of the city\\u2019s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months. Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution. It\\u2019s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises. In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people. It\\u2019s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong\\u2019s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died. After a rocky start, the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive \\u2013 schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings. There is tentative talk that containment efforts are working and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong\\u2019s authorities. The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region\\u2019s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy. The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government\\u2019s classification of protesters as \\u201crioters\\u201d. Only one of the movement\\u2019s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns. \\u201cI think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,\\u201d says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement. \\u201cQuestion one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.\\u201d Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong\\u2019s sociology department, says the protests \\u201clost steam\\u201d, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with the traumatic university sieges and the success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections. Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to \\u201cwarrior style disobedience\\u201d \\u2013 short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement. A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets. \\u201cTo us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital. But when it comes to seeing our home being destroyed by tyranny in every way possible, values we have been upholding are twisted and devastated, the virus seems too minor an issue to hinder us from guarding our home,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWe will never back off. We are willing to do everything to fight against injustice and expose the truth even if our efforts seemed small and powerless.\\u201d There is widespread acceptance that the fear of infection at mass gatherings has played a part in the diminished numbers. However it has also driven its own protests. The already low support and trust in the Hong Kong government and chief executive, Carrie Lam, were compounded by early missteps in responding to the virus. \\u201cThe wrong and inefficient allocation of resources [eg masks] and slow border closures incited hatred in our community too,\\u201d the administrator says, in reference to protests and strikes over Lam\\u2019s reluctance to close borders or place restrictions on travellers from mainland China. \\u201cIf the government had closed the border, we could have been able to stop the epidemic spreading in Hong Kong even more effectively.\\u201d Kong says the policing of protests during the outbreak has been \\u201cmore oppressive than ever\\u201d. Alleged police brutality and mass arrests continue, including three high-profile pro-democracy figures on charges which observers said could apply to almost any protester, as well as hundreds of others at smaller events since. Last Sunday, police were filmed pepper-spraying journalists and bystanders at a demonstration against the establishment of a Covid-19 clinic in a high-density residential area. Just hours later they were again accused of excessive force in trying to shut down a vigil for a young man who died when he fell from a car park during a protest in November. On Wednesday the US State Department accused the Hong Kong government of an \\u201capparent unwillingness to criticise the police force\\u201d or investigate alleged breaches of civil liberties. Hong Kong dismissed the report as foreign interference. Albert Ho, a solicitor and high-profile pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, says it is clear there have been fewer confrontations and clashes since the virus, and authorities appear to be using the quiet time to round up key figures and organisers. \\u201cI think they have come to a stage where they can say they have clamped down on these movements by the youngsters,\\u201d he says. \\u201cSo they have to do everything to deter the social organisers from continuing to organise marches and demonstrations on a big scale.\\u201d Views differ within the movement on whether another organised, police-approved rally could draw people out in their millions again. Junker says it looks like the movement is now trying to re-energise, but there\\u2019s \\u201ca lot of fatalism at this point, saying nothing is working\\u201d. \\u201cThe government has all the resources and institutional levers to follow up in these retributional ways.\\u201d But it\\u2019s hard to predict. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a weird kind of effervescent chemistry where [if] the right things converge and boom, you have two million people out on the street.\\u201d Kong says: \\u201cOne thing is certain \\u2013 distrust and anger with the government has only grown, and people\\u2019s views haven\\u2019t changed: we\\u2019re sick of an unrepresentative and unresponsive government. We want democracy. How that manifests itself is hard to say.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 8, \"content_len\": 1071}, {\"title\": \"Coronavirus outbreak \\u2013 how will it affect my rights, pay and debts?\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-outbreak-how-will-it-affect-my-rights-pay-and-debts\", \"content\": \"People across the UK may soon find themselves out of office for lengthy periods of time, whether they like it or not. It has been estimated that one fifth of the UK\\u2019s workforce could be absent during the weeks when the coronavirus is at its peak while millions more will find themselves working from home or even without anywhere to work. With the disruption to the normal working week comes a myriad of questions for employees, employers, contractors and casual workers about what their rights are at such an unprecedented time \\u2013 and how to ensure that any money problems stay short term and don\\u2019t stretch into the future. Working from home Google was one of the first companies to direct that employees from its European headquarters in Dublin work from home, a move which has been replicated many times in the last few weeks. Employers and companies have been told to talk to their staff as soon as possible and ensure that they have ways to work from home \\u2013 via laptops and mobile phones. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) said anyone who is worried about going into the office should have their concerns listened to by their boss \\u2013 but employers are not obliged to allow for time off nor unpaid leave. But if employees refuse to attend work or any other reasonable request, they could face disciplinary action. What if staff get coronavirus? Employees are entitled to statutory sick pay as long as they are sick for four days and earn at least \\u00a3118 a week before tax. Workers \\u2013 such as agency staff, those on zero-hour contracts and casuals \\u2013 are also likely to be entitled to the \\u00a394.25 weekly payment. Acas says many workplaces offer better terms than the statutory however. In his budget last week, chancellor Rishi Sunak said the four-day rule would be suspended and reduced to one day for anyone who has been advised to self-isolate. Anyone who is not entitled to sick pay has been advised to contact their local jobcentre to see if they are able to claim universal credit or other allowances. Only employees and workers are entitled to statutory sick pay, not the \\u201cgenuinely\\u201d self-employed said Acas. What if people are told to self-isolate but are not sick? Anyone who fears that they may have coronavirus has been told to contact the NHS 111 service. If the service advises someone to self-isolate, then they will be entitled to statutory sick pay. If employees are not sick but are not wanted in work, then they should be paid their usual salary. For workers however, who have fewer employment rights, there is typically no obligation for employers to pay them or for them to provide services. Do people still get paid if a workplace is shut down? Employees should get their normal pay unless contracts entitle the employer to lay them off, in which case they are entitled to five days\\u2019 guaranteed pay. If the contract does not include this right and the workplace is shut for some time, then employers could require staff to take their annual leave while it is closed. What about holidays? Travel has been severely disrupted with limits to flights and cancelled holidays. If someone is intent on going away for a break however, their holidays may be cancelled but sufficient notice must be given. This will be the same amount of time as is being taken by the employee - so if they are going away for two weeks, they need two weeks\\u2019 notice to cancel it. An explanation or justification does not have to be given by the employer. What happens if schools shut? Employees are entitled to one or two days off to arrange for emergencies and could use that to put in place alternative childcare arrangements. This may not be paid time off and can include dependants ranging from spouses, children, parents, people who rely on them for help or people who receive care. Should a child or dependant become unwell and need to self-isolate, then the parent may also need to do so. Money worries Under the government plans, it will now be easier for people to claim sick pay and get benefits. However, the level of benefits that are available will be far below what many people will need to cover their household costs. \\u201cThe government is making changes so it\\u2019s easier and quicker to claim sick pay and to get benefits. Those are welcome but statutory sick pay is only \\u00a394 a week and the standard allowance in universal credit is just \\u00a373 a week \\u2013 that is less than a quarter of the average income. For many people this will mean their normal debt repayments will now become unmanageable,\\u201d said Sara Williams of Debt Camel, a blog advising on debt issues. The worst tactic, she said, is to try and borrow to get through any problems. As the crisis may last a number of weeks, people could see debts mount up and become unaffordable when things do return to normal. Ask for help Banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and TSB are to offer repayment holidays on mortgages and loans, as part of relief measures \\u2013 part of an effort to stem a potential tide of defaults if customers become ill, have to self-isolate or lose pay from employers and clients as the virus continues to spread. In Italy, where the crisis is much more advanced, all mortgage repayments have been suspended. Williams says she hopes more lenders follow the lead set by the banks here not just in home loans but on credit cards and catalogue debt as well. If someone is experiencing difficulty with their repayments, they should talk to their creditors. \\u201cIf your income has dropped because of coronavirus, whether you are ill, you have been told to self-isolate, you are caring for someone ill or children not at school, your hours have been cut or your self-employed income has dropped a lot, tell your creditors and ask for a payment break,\\u201d she said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t wait for your lender to make an announcement. The FCA\\u2019s rules say that all lenders should treat customers who can\\u2019t make payments \\u2018with forbearance and due consideration\\u2019. That means they have to listen to what you say and should look at freezing interest and taking a much lower or no payment.\\u201d And most importantly \\u2026 People should not allow worry to overcome them. Missing just a few payments on credit cards will not result in having to go to court and rushing into insolvency, whether through bankruptcy or a debt relief order, is not a good idea until a payment break has been applied for, says Williams.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 1121}, {\"title\": \"Family Has Way Too Many Daughters For Them Not To Have Been Trying For Son\", \"url\": \"https://local.theonion.com/family-has-way-too-many-daughters-for-them-not-to-have-1824313914\", \"content\": \"Saying it was clear the parents never intended to have such a large brood, sources confirmed Wednesday that the Greene family has way too many daughters for them not to have been trying for a son. \\u201cObviously, after Jess and Katie, they started to get desperate for a boy, otherwise they wouldn\\u2019t have had Ashley,\\u201d said family friend Lisa Contreras, who noted that the Greenes showed no signs of stopping even though they were both nearing 40 and had daughters in daycare, elementary school, and middle school. \\u201cI thought for sure they\\u2019d be done once Sophia was born, but then a year and a half later, along came Charlie.

The flaring, which she says collapses night into day, can be seen more than 20 miles away in Edinburgh. Erskine, a local Labour councillor, describes living in Lochgelly, a former mining community neighbouring Mossmorran, as unpleasant. \\u201cWhen that flare goes, the house does vibrate. For me it\\u2019s something akin to a Nimrod [maritime patrol plane] landing on top of your house. The first time I went out to see if there\\u2019s a helicopter flying overhead.\\u201d Residents, who formed a local action group, are calling on the government to set up an independent inquiry into the health, social, and environmental impact of what they describe as an \\u201cageing\\u201d plant, but this demand has been ignored. For the local community, the flaring has come to symbolise a disconnect from the Scottish government\\u2019s rhetoric about the climate emergency and what it does on the ground. ExxonMobil\\u2019s Fife Ethylene Plant at Mossmorran began production in 1985. Flaring, a process that burns off gas that cannot be processed, can last for several days. As well as planned flaring events, unexpected flaring also occurs as a safety mechanism. It\\u2019s legal on the site that ExxonMobil shares with Shell Fife NGL, but the company has a duty to mitigate the impact it can have on local communities. Last April, the Scottish environmental agency (Sepa) launched a criminal investigation into ExxonMobil because of unplanned flaring. The investigation follows \\u201cfinal warning letters\\u201d issued to ExxonMobil in April 2018 regarding flaring that was found to be \\u201cpreventable and unacceptable\\u201d. \\u201cIn our bedroom, which faces towards Mossmorran, it\\u2019s impossible to keep the light out. It\\u2019s a nightmare,\\u201d said Joe Purves, a 69-year-old recently retired accountant who has lived in Lochgelly for 45 years. He believes the frequency and severity of the flaring has got worse over the last few years. \\u201cThe community are told when there\\u2019s going to be planned flaring, but it\\u2019s the fact the emergency flaring keeps on taking place,\\u201d said Linda Holt, an independent councillor at Fife council. \\u201cThey always say it\\u2019s \\u2018process upset\\u2019 but everyone knows it\\u2019s because something has gone wrong. And things have gone wrong more in the last few years because the plant is ageing.\\u201d Last summer, the plant was shut down to address the mechanical issues the company was having with its boilers and implement preventive work to improve the plant\\u2019s reliability. But unexpected elevated flaring occurred within a month of the plant reopening in February, sparking widespread anger. Chris Dailly, Sepa\\u2019s head of environmental performance, said the watchdog had made it clear ExxonMobil needed to invest further in flaring mitigation technologies and given the company a timeline for compliance. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been clear that flaring has been unacceptable and that compliance with Scotland\\u2019s environmental rules is non-negotiable,\\u201d he said. While 42-year-old James Glen, a graphic and web designer who set up the Mossmorran action group in 2017 with Holt, welcomes Sepa\\u2019s investigation, he argues it\\u2019s not enough. The action group calls for an independent inquiry that looks at health, site safety, and social issues. More than 2,000 people have written to the Scottish environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, echoing the action\\u2019s group demand. A spokesperson for the Scottish government said that as Sepa was concluding its investigation, it \\u201cwould not be appropriate nor helpful for ministers to interfere in independent regulatory decisions, particularly while enforcement investigations are ongoing\\u201d. Glen accuses the Scottish government of \\u201chiding behind Sepa\\u201d and said it should come to meet the community to discuss their concerns. Erskine said Holyrood is already losing credibility on the issue. \\u201cWe should be looking after our constituents, not big business. Our job is the safety and wellbeing of the people that live here. If that plant had been any place near Edinburgh, it would have been shut down.\\u201d Glen says the community\\u2019s concerns about their health had long been dismissed until a 2019 NHS Fife report, which he believes just scratches at the surface, concluded \\u201cit is clear that the degree of physical and psychological disturbance caused to people in the vicinity of Mossmorran has been considerable\\u201d. The report noted the most common health-related concerns among local residents were anxiety, respiratory issues such as asthma, sleeping difficulties, and headaches. It found no evidence of higher than expected cancer rates, while 32 Sepa\\u2019s air quality reports demonstrate no breach of the UK air quality standard. Stuart Neill, the plant\\u2019s public affairs manager, said: \\u201cWe very much regret any concern that flaring may have caused to members of the local community. The safety of our people and neighbours is our most important priority and the ability to flare is a critical part of the plant\\u2019s multiple safety mechanisms.\\u201d Neill added that the plant is one of the youngest facilities of its kind in Europe and as well as investing \\u00a320m annually in maintenance, this year the company would be investing an additional \\u00a3140m to upgrade infrastructure to improve operational reliability and reduce flaring. Glen set up an impact map so residents can report health, social or environmental issues related to Mossmorran. There have been 363 incidents added so far. One report from a resident in Edinburgh notes: \\u201cI genuinely thought tonight that there had been an explosion at the plant given the intensity [of the flaring].\\u201d Another writes: \\u201cIf we see it as far away as North Berwick what must it be like up close?\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 910}, {\"title\": \"Teen who just discovered Led zeppelin starting to piss off friends.\", \"url\": \"https://local.theonion.com/teen-who-just-discovered-led-zeppelin-starting-to-piss-1819566214\", \"content\": \"Mark Campa, 16, who has listened to and talked about Led Zeppelin almost exclusively since discovering the '70s rock group over the summer, is \\\"really starting to piss off\\\" his friends, sources reported Monday.\", \"fake\": \"1\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 34}, {\"title\": \"Thousands Of Students Forced To Attend Iowa State After University Sets Acceptance Rate To 140%\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/thousands-of-students-forced-to-attend-iowa-state-after-1833375032\", \"content\": \"In part of an ongoing effort to foster a more inclusive academic community, thousands of students from across the nation were forced to attend Iowa State Monday after the university set its acceptance rate to 140 percent. \\u201cWe\\u2019d like to congratulate all the people who didn\\u2019t apply, but were nevertheless determined to have the heart of a Cyclone,\\u201d said university president Wendy Wintersteen, who noted that hundreds of required admissions letters were still in the mail, and that those not yet accepted should not lose hope of being conscripted this Fall. \\u201cThe class of 2023 will almost certainly be the most diverse and accomplished freshman cohort in the history of Iowa State.

Phillips, a spirited man of 87, has walked downriver from his home in Pimlico to meet me at Turnips, the oldest speciality greengrocer at the market. He is a fan of its sideline in chanterelle and spelt stew, cooked in huge paella pans. We order a couple of steaming bowls of the thick mushroom dish \\u2013 on a good day they sell 1,400 such bowls, each topped with a piece of parmesan crisp \\u2013 and stand eating them on the cobblestones. Phillips is wearing a red and white spotted toadstool beret. The staff of Turnip Kitchen greet Phillips as something of a prophet, mycologist royalty; new recruits are given his book on mushrooms as their bible. That pioneering volume, first published in 1981 \\u2013 with its vivid description and photographs of hundreds of varieties and stages of growth \\u2013 has enabled two generations of foragers to pick and eat with confidence. Phillips accepts their compliments modestly while polishing off his stew \\u2013 a dish I feel I could eat every winter lunchtime and never tire of. There is some discussion of the origin of the chanterelles \\u2013 Portugal at this time of year \\u2013 and we then wander to the edge of the market to get a glass of wine and sit and talk about the mulchy beginnings of his first love. In the summer of 1940, with the blitz threatened, Phillips was sent away from his parents\\u2019 home in Uxbridge out to his grandparents\\u2019 dairy farm in Hertfordshire. \\u201cIt just so happened that it must have been a marvellous mushrooming year,\\u201d he recalls. \\u201cAged seven or eight I would go out into the fields with these steel milking buckets and bring them back brimful of mushrooms. They grow around cow pats, of course. That was the start of it. My grandmother would cook them up and they sent a few buckets to market. I\\u2019d get half a crown or something for each one.\\u201d The thrill of those days has never left him. I guess a first question with any mushroom hunter is about hallucinogens but Phillips insists he has never had any interest in the \\u201cmagic\\u201d side of his vocation. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like when I worked in advertising in the 60s, people never used to bother to pass me a joint because they knew I didn\\u2019t need it.\\u201d He got all the highs he wanted simply by being in nature, tramping in woods, cooking outside, looking and learning. He wonders if it was genetic. \\u201cMy father was an accountant. I imagine his daily life was bloody boring; but he absolutely loved going out blackberrying or whatever. That was total bliss to him \\u2013 and to me.\\u201d Phillips published books about trees and ferns and wild flowers before he got to mushrooms. He didn\\u2019t think the publisher at Pan would go for it. The British, he suggests, had always been funny about fungi. While across Europe and beyond natives would be out in fields and forests as if on pilgrimage in mushroom season, in the UK there was no tradition. \\u201cWe were famous for herbs from medieval times, of course,\\u201d says Phillips. \\u201cBut those books tend to refer to mushrooms as \\u2018the spit of Jesus\\u2019 or \\u2018the fruit of the devil\\u2019. Because they grew up from nowhere overnight they were associated with witchcraft.\\u201d Those attitudes went surprisingly deep. When he was researching his first mushroom book Phillips was up in Scotland staying on a farm. The farmer was a \\u201ctight sod, who charged you extra for hot water and all that\\u201d. Phillips was out every day collecting chanterelles. One evening he told the farmer: \\u201cYou have millions of these in your woods. Put them in a box and send them to France and you will make a small fortune.\\u201d The farmer looked at him and said simply: \\u201cPeople shouldnae eat that shite.\\u201d \\u201cAnd that was it. That idea was common.\\u201d Phillips\\u2019s evangelising has done much to shift those superstitions. His original book has sold 750,000 copies. Each year he joins the musician and DJ Cerys Matthews at her Good Life Experience festival in north Wales and takes a few hundred people out into the woods. They cook up all the edible stuff they find over a fire pit. It takes him back to when his kids were growing up and they would go out nearly every weekend, rain or snow, collecting wild food. \\u201cIt began when I worried that my son was growing up a townie,\\u201d Phillips recalls. \\u201cWe used to go out to a place near the Grand Union Canal, at Denham. Just set up camp, build a little fire. It sort of took off. He would bring his pals and their parents would come. It was rather wonderful.\\u201d Phillips has been a natural nonconformist. Three months into his national service in the RAF in Canada, he says, he somehow persuaded an air vice marshal to let him go home on the basis that he didn\\u2019t want to be trained to kill people. He later gave up work as an art director at the ad agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, to become a freelance photographer, concentrating on plants. His guiding philosophy has always been: \\u201cIf it\\u2019s not fun, don\\u2019t do it.\\u201d That spirit has taken him all over the world \\u2013 adventures in wild food that are celebrated in his latest book, The Worldwide Forager. The book grew out of his understanding of the propagation of knowledge: \\u201cWe don\\u2019t need governments to connect us, just space where it can happen,\\u201d he says at one point. He hopes the latest book is timely in that it looks beyond our borders. Highlights include his pilgrimage in search of the desert truffle with a Portuguese plant magus. \\u201cAs far as I can make out the desert truffle is the manna referred to in the Bible,\\u201d he suggests. \\u201cAnd we went out and found this thing. Didn\\u2019t taste great, but it was incredibly exciting.\\u201d He has learned a lot, too, from spending time with a Native American tribe, the Nez Perce, in Idaho, who retain some of the ancient knowledge of hunter-gatherers. Not only did Phillips increase his knowledge of edible tubers, he became friends with an eminently quotable chief: \\u201cHow long will it take mankind to realise that you cannot eat money?\\u201d I suggest that, like the hunter-gatherers, Phillips must see a different countryside to the rest of us when he goes for a walk in the woods; so much to eat for a start \\u2026 \\u201cI find that particularly at the seaside,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI always think: what a dreadful waste. Just about everything is edible, and we hardly eat any of it. The Japanese know a hundred things to do with seaweed. I have no idea why we do not.\\u201d Despite all the changes he has witnessed at first hand as a result of factory farming, he remains an optimist. He believes not only that we may see a necessary revival in sustainability, but that some of the more miraculous properties of fungi in particular might yet help us to fix the damage already done to the planet. \\u201cFungi have been used to break down oil spills,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI think they will have a role to play in ridding the world of plastic.\\u201d In the meantime, he follows Voltaire\\u2019s dictum of \\u201ctending his own garden\\u201d. In London this involves organising the planting and upkeep of the communal plot in Ecclestone Square where he lives; and also doing a bit of experimenting at a small cottage he owns in Wiltshire. He cooks and eats outside whenever he can; his last birthday meal involved \\u2013 \\u201cbugger the neighbours\\u201d \\u2013 a wood fire on the balcony of his flat. And what about retirement, I ask, before he heads off back up river. He shudders at the thought. \\u201cWe are going to be dust long enough,\\u201d he says. And then he brightens. \\u201cAccording to a French mycologist there is a mushroom that grows only on the human brain, in graveyards. I suppose because they are uniquely nutritious.\\u201d He laughs at the idea. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s a comforting thought \\u2013 but there it is.\\u201d OFM The Worldwide Forager is published on 2 April (Unbound, \\u00a325).

Sporting events cancelled. Mass gatherings prohibited. Stock markets in freefall. Deserted shopping malls. Get ready for the Covid-19 global recession. Up until a month ago this seemed far-fetched. It was assumed that the coronavirus outbreak would be a localised problem for China and that any spillover effects to the rest of the world could be comfortably managed by a bit of policy easing by central banks. When it became clear that Covid-19 was not confined to China and that the economic effects would be more widespread, forecasts started to be revised down. But central banks, finance ministries and independent economists took comfort from the fact that there would be a sharp but short hit to activity followed by a rapid return to business as usual. This line of thinking has exact parallels with the events of 2007, when it was initially assumed that the subprime mortgage crisis was a minor and manageable problem affecting only the US \\u2013 and nobody needs reminding how that ended. If history is any guide, the global economy will eventually recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, but the idea that this is going to be a V-shaped recession in the first half of 2020 followed by a recovery in the second half of the year looks absurd after the tumultuous events of the past week. What\\u2019s more, policymakers know as much. The Federal Reserve \\u2013 the US central bank \\u2013 did not need to be told by Donald Trump that it needed to cut interest rates and resume large-scale asset purchases known as quantitative easing. The world\\u2019s most powerful central bank pulled out the stops on Sunday night by slashing rates to nearly zero and pledging to expand its balance sheet by $700bn. In the UK the coordinated response by the Bank of England and the Treasury last week was seen as a textbook example of how policymakers ought to respond to the crisis. It was, though, only the start. Airline companies will quickly go bust unless they receive financial assistance. The same goes for retailers, many of them hanging on by their fingertips even before Covid-19. Britain has a new chancellor of the exchequer in Rishi Sunak and, from Monday, a new governor of the Bank of England in Andrew Bailey, and they will both be aware that the risks of doing too little too late are far greater than those of doing too much too soon. So, in the coming weeks the Bank can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1% \\u2013 the lowest they have ever been \\u2013 and to resume its QE programme. Sunak will have to add to the \\u00a312bn he has set aside to deal with Covid-19. As in 2008-09, the authorities in the eurozone have been slowest to act but there have been welcome signs in recent days \\u2013 from Germany, most significantly \\u2013 of the need for governments to spend, and spend big. It has been clear from the start that Covid-19 affects both sides of the economy: supply and demand. The supply of goods and services is impaired because factories and offices are shut and output falls as a result. But demand also falls because consumers stay at home and stop spending, and businesses mothball investment. Conventional policy measures \\u2013 such as cutting the cost of borrowing or reducing taxes \\u2013 tend to work better when there is a demand shock. There is a limit to what they can do in the event of a combined supply and demand shock. Policymakers know that, which is why Sunak stressed in his budget speech that the economy faced a tough period. The aim is make the downturn as short and shallow as possible, even though the chances of this look vanishingly small. One reason for that is because the economic disruption caused by Covid-19 is enormous. Entire countries \\u2013 Italy and Spain \\u2013 are in lockdown. The problems facing airline companies are symptomatic of a crisis facing the global travel industry, from cruise companies to hotels that cater for tourists. Discretionary spending by consumers appears to have collapsed in recent days. Despite globalisation, much economic activity remains local but here, too, there will be an impact as people cancel appointments at the dentist, put off having their hair cut and wait to put their house on the market. Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at Capital Economics, has estimated that output in Britain will shrink by 2.5% in the second quarter but says a 5% fall is possible. The more pessimistic estimate looks quite plausible. What\\u2019s more, in a service-sector dominated economy much of the lost output is never going to be recovered. If people do not go out to their weekly meal at their favourite local restaurant for the next two months they are not going to eat out four times a week when the fear of infection has been lifted. It also seems likely that the economic pain will go on for longer than originally estimated. Having imposed bans and restrictions, governments and private-sector bodies will be cautious about removing them. Countries such as Italy will be wary of opening their borders while there is a fear of reinfection. The idea that Premier League football will be back by early April is fanciful. There is also a question of how long it will take consumer and business confidence to recover. Policy action by central banks and finance ministries can help in this respect but only so much. The chances are that the imminent recession will be U-shaped: a steep decline followed by a period of bumping along the bottom. There will be recovery but it will take time and only after much damage has been caused.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 9, \"content_len\": 952}, {\"title\": \"Paul Ryan Confident American People Will Warm Up To Tax Plan Once They Realize Life A Cruel And Meaningless Farce\", \"url\": \"https://politics.theonion.com/paul-ryan-confident-american-people-will-warm-up-to-tax-1821509050\", \"content\": \"Saying the current disapproval would soon give way to support, House Speaker Paul Ryan was confident Thursday that the American people will warm up to the new tax plan once they realize life is a cruel and meaningless farce. \\u201cAlthough it may not be very popular now, I\\u2019m certain that Americans will come around to this new system when they begin to understand the ruthless absurdity of existence,\\u201d said Ryan, explaining that once taxpayers see that there is no objective moral framework in the unforgiving chaos of the universe, they will learn to appreciate what this bill actually does. \\u201cI think many voters will find a lot in this tax overhaul that they can embrace when it finally dawns on them that they have no agency and it\\u2019s futile to resist entropy.

The outbreak has already led to large US companies including AT&amp;T, Ford and General Motors sending workers home and has hit industries, especially the travel and leisure industry, particularly hard.

New Zealand is one of the few remaining countries \\u2013 and last western nation \\u2013 that accepts imports from the contested territory in West Africa, forcibly occupied by Morocco since 1975. Morocco\\u2019s claims to the territory are largely unrecognised internationally. The Polisario Front \\u2013 the political arm of the Western Saharan independence movement \\u2013 has lodged documents in the New Zealand high court saying the New Zealand Superannuation Fund, with $45bn under management, is exposed to unlawful practices through its investments in farms that use Western Saharan phosphate, and interests in companies operating in the occupied territory. Fertiliser companies Ravensdown and Ballance Agri-Nutrients in New Zealand are the only companies in the western world that import phosphate from Western Sahara, spread on New Zealand farms. The phosphate rock mined in Western Sahara has low levels of cadmium suitable for New Zealand soil conditions, although alternatives are available from other sources. In 2017, the Polisario Front won a South African court action, seizing a load of fertiliser in port in Port Elizabeth, ordered by Ballance Agri-Nutrients, and bound for New Zealand. The court ruled Morocco had no legal claim to the phosphate, and could not sell it to a third party. \\u201cThe Sahrawi people are determined to protect their natural resources with all available means,\\u201d the Polisario Front\\u2019s representative of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic to Australia and New Zealand, Kamal Fadel, said. \\u201cThis legal action is a message to all who are involved in the exploitation of Sahrawi natural resources that they face legal action, reputational risks and investor withdrawal.\\u201d The movement\\u2019s claim to the high court said the NZ Super Fund\\u2019s involvement in Western Saharan phosphate trade was inconsistent with statutory obligations to manage and administer the fund in a manner \\u201cconsistent with avoiding prejudice to New Zealand\\u2019s reputation as a responsible member of the world community\\u201d. Fadel said the court action was determined to stop the extraction of Western Saharan resources and said the NZ Super Fund must \\u201cput an end to their illegal involvement in the exploitation of the natural resources of our country\\u201d. \\u201cNew Zealand companies have plundered our phosphate for decades. The blood phosphate illegal trade must end.\\u201d A spokesman for the Guardians of the NZ Super Fund said the fund was invested in several farms that used Western Sahara-sourced phosphate, and had a limited equity exposure through passive index funds to international companies that operated in the territory.

These obligations are integrated into the Guardians\\u2019 investment activities through its responsible investment framework. \\u201cThe Guardians believes it has appropriately applied its responsible investment framework in a manner that meets its legislative obligations to manage the fund in a manner consistent with best practice portfolio management and avoiding prejudice to New Zealand\\u2019s reputation as a responsible member of the world community.

Western Sahara is regarded by the United Nations as a \\u201cnon-self-governing territory\\u201d, but international proposals for referenda and autonomy plans have failed to break the four-decade impasse.

A few shops away, young men drinking hot sweet tea cradle rifles in their laps and wave at passersby. Above them, a billboard advertises books from Cambridge University Press and McGraw-Hill. Yemen\\u2019s third-largest city was once known as its capital of culture. Taizis prided themselves on producing the best-educated people who became the best teachers, lawyers, pilots, you name it. Now it is known as Yemen\\u2019s longest-running battlefield, the most heavily bombed by blistering Saudi airstrikes, the deadliest governorate in Yemen\\u2019s devastating war. The conflict, which enters its sixth year this month, pits the Houthis aligned to Iran against Yemen\\u2019s government backed by a Saudi-led coalition supported by western military powers. And Taiz has had its own combustible mix of infighting among rival groups armed by the coalition, including political Islamists and hardline Salafists comprising gunmen accused of links to al-Qaida. \\u201cI know what this city was. I know what I went to school for,\\u201d Qaisi says, his eyes watering. Attention to Taiz\\u2019s plight has been eclipsed by alarm over the fate of more strategic battlefields, including the contested Red Sea port city of Hodeida. The last major effort to push Yemen away from war in December 2018, in UN-brokered negotiations outside Stockholm, only reached an \\u201cunderstanding\\u201d on the need to talk about Taiz. It didn\\u2019t go any further. And adding Taiz to Yemen\\u2019s long shopping list has made it even harder. \\u201cNow its fate is linked to a much bigger picture in a three-dimensional chess game,\\u201d says Peter Salisbury of the International Crisis Group. In recent weeks, after one of the quietest periods in this war, there\\u2019s been an upsurge in fighting on key frontlines across Yemen. Taiz is a city split in two, an ugly emblem of the wider conflict tearing a whole country apart. From the top of Jabal Sabir, the city\\u2019s towering mountain, inside the hollow pockmarked shell of what was once a prized tourist resort, there\\u2019s a dazzling view. A vista that once drew visitors now provides the best vantage point to understand Taiz\\u2019s political topography. The frontline slashes through the city from east to west, leaving a visible green and brown scar. Greenery has spread like tentacles across the no man\\u2019s land. Beyond this line, about a third of Taiz is in the hands of Houthis who control the heights overlooking the northern edge of the city. The rest is run by the government. Close up, it\\u2019s a seam crackling with tension. After securing permission from the head of a neighbourhood committee on the government side, whose members identify themselves as the \\u201cresistance\\u201d, we descend winding steps, sheltered by dark shadows and stone walls riddled with bullet holes, to a largely deserted lane. \\u201cMy family is hiding at home,\\u201d one of our escorts, in a Yemeni patterned turban and traditional \\u201cfuta\\u201d skirt, says as we hang back a bit from the open street. \\u201cWhoever goes out gets shot by the Houthis.\\u201d Families are caught in the crosshairs of both sides. War bestowed a new title on Taiz: \\u201ccity of snipers\\u201d. From where we stand, we see how life has been pulled from homes facing the line of fire. Building facades are like mournful faces of black-eyed windows and gaping holes. Another man hurries past. \\u201cThere\\u2019s only one street between my home and the Houthis,\\u201d he says, pointing the other way as he catches his breath. \\u201cMy family was so scared they left.\\u201d Beyond this alley, daily life is a battle. All roads in and out of Taiz, except one, are controlled by the Houthis. \\u201cWe were invited to cross to the other side for talks but clashes broke out and both sides shot at us,\\u201d recalls Abdul Kareen Shaiban with a grimace as he remembers a negotiating effort years ago. An MP who chairs a roads committee, he\\u2019s talked many times over many years to both sides. We\\u2019re standing on what was once a bustling main road running though Taiz, which connected it to other major cities including the capital Sana\\u2019a in the north. A few goats pick their way down the carriageway and a little boy furiously pedals past on his beat-up bicycle. We can see the rusted metal barriers overgrown with shrubbery blocking the road a short distance away. \\u201cPeople inside this city have nothing to do with politics or war. They just simply want to live and they need a road,\\u201d Shaiban says. \\u201cThe siege has made life difficult and deadly,\\u201d chimes in Dalia Nasr of another initiative, Taizi Women for Life. She knows the danger \\u2013 a sniper\\u2019s bullet blinded her in one eye. Her aunt, two brothers and a nephew were killed during clashes. Nasr explains how blocking the roads splits life in two: patients with chronic illnesses are separated from specialised hospitals; students can\\u2019t make it to their universities; workers living on the government side can\\u2019t reach factories mainly concentrated in the area under Houthi control. Getting to the other side of Taiz used to be a five-minute drive. Now it takes more than five hours. We take this route, which hugs mountains with breathtaking sheer drops, bumps along a dirt track through soaring palm trees and runs through checkpoints manned by rival groups. We weren\\u2019t given permission by the Houthi authorities to spend time on the other side. Everyone we meet in Taiz remembers what happened to them as if it was yesterday. \\u201cNo one pays attention to us,\\u201d says Marwan with palpable anger. We\\u2019re standing in the rubble of his home, where 10 relatives died as they slept in an airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition. It happened five years ago. The house, and Marwan, are still in pieces. \\u201cTo this day we\\u2019ve received no explanation from the local authorities or the army or the coalition,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWe still don\\u2019t know why they hit a neighbourhood full of civilians.\\u201d Airstrikes by the coalition \\u2013 often with UK- or US-made bombs \\u2013 have caused the most civilian casualties in Taiz, and other battlefields across Yemen, according to figures compiled by the UN and other data sources including Acled (Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project). \\u201cThe attack was so aggressive it took us six days to find the body parts,\\u201d Marwan recalls. \\u201cWe looked for them in nearby houses, on the streets and on the roofs.\\u201d Eight of his neighbours perished in the same attack. A Yemeni government official accompanying us insists we also visit a home destroyed by the Houthis. We\\u2019re greeted by a gaggle of children. A little girl in a red velvet dress, braids sticking out like a Yemeni Pippa Longstocking, starts chattering about the attack that killed her playmate next door. The boy\\u2019s mother, Zahra, soon arrives with graphic photographs of that fateful day. Their home is still a mess of shattered windows and walls. \\u201cEveryone sold Yemen for their own benefit,\\u201d Zahra declares bitterly. \\u201cThe Houthis work with Iran, half the resistance works with Saudi Arabia, the other half with the United Arab Emirates.\\u201d It\\u2019s a lament not just about the main warring parties, but also skirmishes between local forces trained and armed by Arab states in the coalition. Zahra\\u2019s story is the story of Yemen\\u2019s war. Her youngest son died in the first strike, her older son was later shot dead, a daughter lost an eye and her husband went mad with grief. \\u201cThey see this huge crisis happening to us and no one does anything.\\u201d When we leave, Zahra hurries after us with freshly baked Yemeni bread \\u2013 a reminder, if one was needed, that even this merciless war can\\u2019t completely crush a kind and cultured people.

He adjudicated on disputes involving government administrative agencies, delivering justice to vulnerable people with skill and compassion. He began deciding welfare benefit appeals in 1984 as a member of social security tribunals and many thousands of appellants appreciated his incisive decisions. From 1993, he decided to specialise in that particular area of law, ceasing more lucrative work at the bar, and accepting appointment as a full-time legal chair of appeal tribunals. He was commended in 1996 for a unique collegiate approach to administration and personal development. In 1999 he became full-time district chair of appeal tribunals for east England, a position he held until his retirement. In 2008, as part of judicial reorganisation, tribunal legal chairs were at last recognised for the comprehensive work they performed and accordingly he was formally appointed a judge of the first-tier tribunal (social entitlement chamber). He had worked in most areas of the tribunal service, and his knowledge of social security law was recognised as \\u201cencyclopedic\\u201d. Born in Oxford, David was the son of John Turrell, an auto body assembler, and his wife, Mary (nee Jackson). He went to Oxford grammar school, continued his studies with the Workers\\u2019 Educational Association and then signed up for a degree in social and political science at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. In 1971 he joined the Prison Service, serving for seven years and rising to be deputy governor of Bullwood Hall, a prison for women and young offenders in Essex. After a year\\u2019s further study his degree was converted to a diploma in law and, after passing the bar examinations, he achieved his ambition, becoming a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1979. In 1978 he married Elizabeth Galvin, a doctor, who practised in Hockley, Essex, where the family settled. They had two children, Richard and Michael. David enjoyed his family, fellowship, rugby and travelling to the Greek islands. He was also a stalwart supporter of St Peter and St Paul\\u2019s church in Hockley.

His soup cans are almost 60, their whites now fading to grey. Few enough people dine daily on Campbell\\u2019s soup, as he did, for these paintings to sustain their significance as demotic homages any more. The common soup for the common man is recognisable these days mainly as blue chip Warhol. Tate Modern, in considering how to present the artist for a new generation, has eliminated almost everything that lacks the split-second familiarity that mattered so much to Warhol. His output as a portraitist, for instance, is generously edited. Instead of the dubious sitters \\u2013 from German industrialists to the Shah of Iran \\u2013 whose faces he (or his assistants) depicted by production-line rote, we are given only the immortals \\u2013 Elvis, Marilyn, Jackie \\u2013 or those still-living stars whose fame survives in our time. Debbie Harry in violet and turquoise, lime and sulphur colour-ways; Mick Jagger in 1975, with the wrong-shaped head and hairdo, in tarry dun and Elastoplast pink, his youthful beauty squandered. There are, after all, good and bad Warhols. There are also better and worse surveys, and this is decidedly the latter. Its drive is largely biographical, with a particular emphasis on sex. The curators want to quash the old myth of Andy as celibate voyeur, embarrassed by his pocked skin and sparse hair, and tell instead the evolutionary narrative of what\\u2019s prissily described as his \\u201cqueer identity\\u201d. There are many images of the men Warhol fancied, and with whom he had affairs. The very first gallery has a side room in which his 1964 film Sleep is showing. The poet John Giorno, Warhol\\u2019s lover, is seen naked and sleeping in all his dark beauty, body foreshortened like that of some dead Renaissance Christ. This opening room sets the worshipful tone with relics: family albums; childhood photographs; the passenger manifest recording his beloved mother Julia\\u2019s arrival from Slovakia at Ellis Island in 1921. You see her again, later, talking in the East Slavic language Rusyn to her son in one of several videos taped in the Manhattan building they shared for years. Warhol did not attend her funeral, however; he was supposed to have become especially death-averse after being shot in 1968 by Valerie Solanas. Confronted in this show by Richard Avedon\\u2019s vast black-and-white photograph of Warhol\\u2019s torso \\u2013 stitched up, the artist said, like a Chanel dress \\u2013 that argument feels more simplistic than ever. Warhol poses like a model, parting his leather jacket and pulling down his underwear to bare his body. The swank is as much due to Warhol as Avedon. Death steals through this show, from the eerie shadows of his Electric Chair sequence, where the restraints lie slack on the ground after the corpse has been removed, to the shocking image of a suicide falling from a building, over and again, in Warhol\\u2019s trademark repetitions. Here is Pink Race Riot, where you have to peer into the array of news shots of Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963 to notice the trained dog in the maelstrom. One after the other, the images have become so degraded they are scarcely legible; the dog has more prominence than the victims. \\u201cEverything I do is connected with death,\\u201d he said, and it is central to Warhol\\u2019s method, the silkscreen prints taking the original photograph to the verge of dissolution with their blurry overlays and fadings, as the ink runs out. This is especially true of widowed Jackie, silver Elvis, the horrifying car crashes and Marilyn, dwindling from colour to ashen grey. Warhol began making these paintings immediately after her death; they have the status of exequies. But the power of these classics is appallingly undermined at Tate Modern. The curators have selected one painting from each series \\u2013 as if they were mere tokens \\u2013 and jammed them indiscriminately together in a single room like miscellaneous merchandise at the Affordable Art Fair. You cannot stand at any distance from them, noticing their qualities and distinctions, absorbing their unique combination of graphic magnificence and froideur, their weird force of personality. And the Brillo boxes are heaped like coal in a corner, behind a cordon, so you can\\u2019t walk round them appreciating their double life as both paintings and sculptures. There is a sense of hurrying through the masterworks to get back to the story. And, sure enough, far more attention is given to mocking up the Factory in the next room. Here the silver walls reflect Steve Shore\\u2019s famous shots of Andy and Lou and emaciated Edie et al, hanging out among the original silver walls. The Screen Tests \\u2013 where everyone is forced to sit still, or not, before Warhol\\u2019s camera \\u2013 are an evergreen fascination. Dylan licks his lips, Debbie breaks into a smile, William Burroughs drags on a surprisingly senatorial cigar. Each portrait starts out as a still but quickens into suspenseful drama. But then it\\u2019s back to old copies of Interview magazine, clips from home movies, photographs of Warhol on the Manhattan party scene, on television, as gossip column editor. Three of his wigs, white with creepy black under-hair, are laid out like dead creatures in a case. At times it feels as if the biography is taking over, the art an epiphenomenon to the overwhelming fame. There are exceptions, specifically the gallery devoted to the 1975 series Ladies and Gentlemen. These portraits of drag performers from New York nightclubs are life-size, rapturous in their exuberant whorls and shifts of colour. One sitter, only known as Lurdes, is portrayed with such ecstatic sweeps that the features seem to melt; as if both subject and artist were getting out of their heads. A wall text frets over the correct terminology \\u2013 not knowing how Lurdes might have self-identified. But about Warhol himself there hardly seems much doubt. Blake Gopnik\\u2019s newly published biography\\u2013 necessarily monumental, given the prodigious scale of Warhol\\u2019s social and professional life \\u2013 makes his proclivities plain \\u2013 plain as the art itself, with its lavish love of male beauty. The curators appear slightly wistful that they cannot make a queer activist of Warhol. In the final gallery, 60 black-and-white prints of Leonardo\\u2019s The Last Supper are presented in sombre but glamorous lighting \\u2013 a memorial wall, or so runs the wishful caption, invoking those who have died of Aids-related illnesses. But the work was commissioned by a Milan gallery in response to the restoration of The Last Supper; a print of it hung in Julia\\u2019s kitchen; and Warhol rarely missed mass. You can cut the deck another way. Sixty Last Suppers is ultimately as affectless as Warhol so often wants to be. That it gets an entire gallery to itself exposes the flaws of this slight and ill-selected show. Stint on the art, in all its variations, in favour of identity politics and you get exactly the kind of zeitgeist pieties that would surely have bored Warhol himself. \\u2022 Andy Warhol is at Tate Modern, London, until 6 September\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 8, \"content_len\": 1174}, {\"title\": \"\\u2018No Way To Prevent This,\\u2019 Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1823016659\", \"content\": \"In the hours following a violent rampage in Florida in which a lone attacker killed 17 individuals and seriously injured over a dozen others, citizens living in the only country where this kind of mass killing routinely occurs reportedly concluded Wednesday that there was no way to prevent the massacre from taking place. \\u201cThis was a terrible tragedy, but sometimes these things just happen and there\\u2019s nothing anyone can do to stop them,\\u201d said Indiana resident Harold Turner, echoing sentiments expressed by tens of millions of individuals who reside in a nation where over half of the world\\u2019s deadliest mass shootings have occurred in the past 50 years and whose citizens are 20 times more likely to die of gun violence than those of other developed nations. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a shame, but what can we do?

Lots of us would enjoy living in that bubble for weeks, assuming this was a normal March, without the existential threat of coronavirus. The case in favour was articulated in the Cheltenham paddock by Mike Dillon, now a consultant in racing after 46 years with Ladbrokes, during which time he was credited with helping to save the Grand National. \\u201cWe\\u2019re all here for four days, we all enjoy it but there\\u2019s people who have to work and can\\u2019t come,\\u201d Dillon said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got to do anything we can to showcase the industry. We can\\u2019t just be dyed in the wool. Everyone said you can\\u2019t take the Festival to four days from three and look at what a success the four is.\\u201d Dillon recalls being involved in that move, in 2005, because Ladbrokes became the sponsor of the Stayers\\u2019 Hurdle, moved from its position as a supporting race on Gold Cup day to being the feature race on the Festival\\u2019s third day. When Ascot was mulling the idea of extending its Royal meeting to a fifth day, as a way of marking the Queen\\u2019s Golden Jubilee in 2002, Dillon\\u2019s opinion was sought. He remembers course officials insisting: \\u201cIt\\u2019ll just be once. It\\u2019ll never happen after that.\\u201d Dillon adds wryly: \\u201cWell, of course, pounds shillings and pence obviously took over.\\u201d Royal Ascot\\u2019s Saturday quickly became a huge success, which some of those working at Cheltenham are interested in replicating. Is there a large number of people waiting for the chance to attend a Saturday there? Dillon reckons so. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a totally different person who would come on the Saturday,\\u201d he says, and for that reason he regards the extra day as inevitable. Sharing that view is the trainer Oliver Sherwood, who said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s only a matter of time.\\u201d This might be regarded as inside information, because Sherwood is friends with Martin St Quinton, the Cheltenham chairman. Sherwood, who trained Monkerhostin and other horses for St Quinton, was not worried about the need for extra races, regarded by some as likely to dilute the quality of existing Festival contests. \\u201cIf they bring it down to six races a day instead of seven, there\\u2019s only going to be two extra races. So it\\u2019s not much to worry about.\\u201d Brough Scott, the much admired journalist and broadcaster, has a clear idea about what one of those races might be. \\u201cThe race they ought to have, because it would be popular and very good television, is a women jockeys\\u2019 race. I can\\u2019t think why not. And that wouldn\\u2019t change the rest of the Festival programme, essentially.\\u201d However, he doubted whether Cheltenham was inclined to make the move any time soon. \\u201cWe\\u2019re running into very heavy economic headwinds but if the economy thrives and jump racing continues to thrive, why not? You\\u2019re not changing the face of racing. The difference is not really as great as it seems.\\u201d Perhaps unexpectedly, a bookmaker provides a dissenting voice. \\u201cI do worry you could end up killing the golden goose,\\u201d said Simon Clare, who represents Ladbrokes Coral. \\u201cGoing from three to four, I was a big fan and I think it has worked. But five, are you in danger of making it too long? Would it dull the appeal? You don\\u2019t want to end up turning more into less. \\u201cI prefer to leave it as it is because I think it\\u2019s great. If you want to improve racing, focus on other areas, like a weak January. Taking your biggest success story and just trying to make it bigger is not necessarily the most logical approach.\\u201d Trainers are almost obliged to welcome the idea of more races they could win for their clients, the owners. But Willie Mullins, who was once more top trainer last week, said: \\u201cI find it hard enough, personally, to get through four days. \\u201cAlready, I think, people are coming for the first two days and going home, or coming for the last two days.

Listener Steve wondered if Maskell was getting full pay or sick pay, but she confessed she hadn\\u2019t even asked as yet. Later, we got the budget, which was the usual shouting and sneering fest. Why were MPs going to the Houses of Parliament at all, wondered many 5 Live listeners, given that one of them had tested positive? Why couldn\\u2019t they all just stay at home and listen to the radio for the chancellor\\u2019s speech? \\u201cWe\\u2019d take it wherever Rishi Sunak was,\\u201d agreed Barnett. \\u201cWe\\u2019d just link up the mics.\\u201d If unnecessary gatherings are to be cancelled for health reasons, I do hope that parliament leads by example. All MPs should immediately self-isolate in their bedrooms, eat delivery pizza and attempt a spot of online work, before getting distracted by the internet, spraying around some disinfectant and spending three hours bitching about the state of the world on social media. Finally, they\\u2019ll start to understand the youth of today. Or they could catch up on The Archers, which has gone tonto this week. Not a peep about Covid-19, but a surprise explosion at Grey Gables, which took out Lynda Snell (oh no!) and a random builder called Blake. A soil pipe was leaking under the kitchen floor, throwing the country hotel into some disarray: Fallon had to send over some emergency quiche. Philip agreed to have some of his builder lads sort out the kitchen \\u2013 his son, Gavin, was one of them \\u2013 and something must have gone wrong because the whole place exploded, just as Tracy was having a heart to heart withEmma about Emma divorcing Ed Grundy, and Lynda was telling the builders to stop making so much noise. The explosion was a genuine shock. No foreshadowing, nothing to indicate it might happen: such is the way of unplanned explosions, I suppose. Silly Freddie Pargetter, who had spent the previous episode being cross with Lynda (it happens), ended up being trapped beneath the rubble with her, and had to try and drag her out, poor lad. Lynda said nothing at all: this did not bode well. Tuesday\\u2019s episode, in the hospital, was very well done. Robert, Lynda\\u2019s husband, was in bits, with Jim trying to talk him down: beautiful acting from Graham Blockey and John Rowe. And Freddie\\u2019s talk to his auntie Shula (Toby Laurence and Judy Bennett) was also very moving: he didn\\u2019t save Lynda, he said, he\\u2019d given up. \\u201cThe fire was right by her feet.\\u201d Lynda Snell, played by Carole Boyd, is an immensely popular Archers character \\u2013 a meddling busybody, a know-all snob \\u2013 and I do hope she\\u2019s OK. But with a collapsed lung, fractured pelvis and \\u201cfull-thickness burns\\u201d, it doesn\\u2019t sound good. If coronavirus brings too many infectious patients into Borchester General, Lynda may well be a goner. Which would be, for many Archers listeners, the absolute end. Three great apocalyptic podcasts War of the Worlds Orson Welles\\u2019s wireless dramatisation of HG Wells\\u2019s The War of the Worlds famously caused widespread panic across the US after it was broadcast one evening in 1938. The wonderful Radiolab celebrated this event in one of its live episodes, and it\\u2019s a lovely listen, as always. We get the facts \\u2013 only around 1 in 12 people actually panicked when they heard it; we hear from those who believed it; and we also get consideration of whether such a broadcasting event could happen again. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the way that the story unfolded, step by step by step,\\u201d says presenter Jad Abumrad\\u2026 We\\u2019re Alive/Goldrush We\\u2019re Alive, one of the best and earliest drama podcasts, ran from 2009-14, and is considered the gold standard of contemporary apocalypse shows. It\\u2019s a full-on zombie affair, set in downtown Los Angeles, and there are 143 episodes, so you\\u2019re in for a nice long binge-listen, if you happen to be stuck indoors for a long time. Plus, the company that made We\\u2019re Alive has just put out a 10-part follow-up, Goldrush, set 17 years after We\\u2019re Alive\\u2019s main events. We\\u2019re Alive is an imaginative teenagers\\u2019 dream and nightmare rolled into one. Perfect for these crazy days. Ash Tales A fairly recent podcast, Ash Tales is a story show: we hear new short fiction about the end of the world, nicely narrated by presenter Ryan Law, with each episode coming in under 20 minutes. It\\u2019s a spin-off from Ash Tales\\u2019s main website, which showcases new writing about various end-of-the-world scenarios: super plagues, nuclear disasters, you know the stuff. It could perhaps do with a different narrator from time to time, and some added audio atmosphere, but the stories are great and this is a small, interesting British show that\\u2019s worth supporting.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 1122}, {\"title\": \"The week in TV: Breeders; The Trouble With Maggie Cole; Child of Our Time and more\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/15/breeders-tv-review-the-trouble-with-maggie-cole-child-of-our-time-better-call-saul\", \"content\": \"Breeders | Sky One The Trouble With Maggie Cole (ITV) | ITV Hub Child of Our Time (BBC Two) | iPlayer Better Call Saul | Netflix Inside No 9 (BBC Two) | iPlayer Mrs Fletcher | Sky Comedy Breeders burst scatologically on to our screens, with Martin Freeman proving, if he has to prove anything now, that he\\u2019s something of a whiz back where we first encountered him \\u2013 comedy. It\\u2019s an intense, often scabrously funny series about the perils of parenthood, yet as far from Outnumbered \\u2013 even from Motherland \\u2013 as it\\u2019s possible to get and still have a related premise. Paul (Freeman) hates his kids. Don\\u2019t get him wrong; he would die for them. But it\\u2019s just sometimes \\u2013 rather often, in fact, of late \\u2013 he finds himself swearing with unaccountable venom and many, many words of the F variety at them.

Daisy Haggard plays long-term partner Ally (and mother to Luke and Ava) no less superbly: it\\u2019s surprisingly rare for an on-screen pairing to be able to convince that they actually have S.E.X. with each other, and their tight-knit, witty bitching about rival, \\u201cperfect\\u201d schoolgate parents is a delight that never flags. Paul and Ally\\u2019s basic dilemma is, of course, little more than parents have struggled with for long decades, as mores, and attitudes to children, have changed tiresomely fast \\u2013 but writers Simon Blackwell, Chris Addison (and Freeman) have taken some not-new premises (the near-crashes when kids wriggle from seatbelts, the quirks of simpering teachers) and dialled them all up to 11. That Tap reference surely is the ideal time to note that Ally\\u2019s wayward, charming father is played by Michael McKean: in fact all the supporting cast, including the children and Paul\\u2019s father Jim (Alun Armstrong, vouchsafed some drily wonderful lines) are finely cast. Yet it\\u2019s to Haggard and especially to Freeman our eyes are constantly drawn: you can see the skull beneath the skin, practically feel the iron band tightening round the head, of Paul. It\\u2019s a triumph; but it\\u2019s not a cosy watch. What is unfortunately a cosy watch is The Trouble With Maggie Cole. Its heart might be in the right place but its brain\\u2019s in a jar. The title character is played by either Dawn French or, seemingly, Pam Ayres, depending on where the light falls; we\\u2019re obviously meant to warm to her, as the well-meaning, nose-poking busybody in a gorgeous little Cornish seaside hamlet, but I\\u2019ve warmed more to busy bluebottles. Self-important Maggie, anyway, has spilt the beans, drunkenly, on local radio about six village characters with secrets, and is thus racked with guilt for her pointless gossip. But she somehow seems to have hit a seam of truth about at least two or three, and thus the stage is set for confrontations and reckonings. The trouble with The Trouble With\\u2026 is that it\\u2019s billed as a comedy-drama, and one of its main sins is that it\\u2019s relentlessly unfunny. To say it falls short of The Vicar of Dibley is not a compliment. It might have worked as a simple drama (a big \\u201cmight\\u201d) but as it stands it is a simple waste of a grand cast, including Julie Hesmondhalgh. I was nonplussed by Child of Our Time, surely one of the last outings for what began with fanfares in 2000 by promising to follow 25 children throughout the 21st century and define, finally, whether nature or nurture was more vital to development. Some time in the last few years this ambitious premise wibbled to a halt: and so this Turning 20 special featured only three of our ex-babies, now all growed up. Eve, Rhianna and Jamie spoke wise and perfect (and tolerant) sense, and gave the utter lie to the idea of millennials as flaky needfuls. Less surprised by the parents: as one of the blizzard of statistics that rolled by on-screen informed, 12 of the 21 couples who signed up have since divorced. And I was frustrated, too, at some of these stats: as soon as we were told that the number of children reporting anxiety/depression has leapt 45% since 1999, we were told \\u201ctalking openly about anxiety and depression has become increasingly acceptable during the 21st century\\u201d \\u2013 and no questioning from the producers as to whether the two might be cause-and-effect linked. Better Call Saul continues to be the consistently underrated best thing on Netflix since the start of its penultimate series a few weeks ago. It\\u2019s bowling along with its slow but unstoppable momentum. Ex half-decent lawyer Jimmy McGill is firmly established as Saul Goodman, wholly sold out as every chiseller\\u2019s clever lawyer, making surprising bucks and burning surprising bridges. But last week\\u2019s (relatively unviolent, for once) Namaste episode heavily featured Rhea Seehorn as Kim, the confidante/girlfriend and an ever mesmerising actor, continually trying to do her best for the world. Whether she can haul Saul back from the abyss is surely set to become one fascinating showdown\\u2026 I think, not wanting to spoil, but anyone who\\u2019s seen Breaking Bad might know the answer. Inside No 9 ended another sublime run with a sharp enough wee story, yet the last three minutes we got, sigh, bloody vampires, snore. I can only assume this was a nod to Shearsmith/Pemberton\\u2019s old pal Mark Gatiss, who had nodded (the ship\\u2019s cabin in the middle episode was \\u2013 guess what number?) in his wonderful festive Dracula. Never mind: this run has featured an unimpeachably high standard of writing, some standout acting (David Morrissey, Maxine Peake, Ioanna Kimbook) and twists to leave your nape cold. Sky Comedy\\u2019s Mrs Fletcher is quite the find. Kathryn Hahn is the mild suburban divorcee coming to reluctant terms with the flight of spoilt (overindulged) son Brendan to college, and wondering just what and where the blither she finds to do next. After searching vainly for internet help (\\u201cLearn to love your empty nest! Take a long hot bath! Get lost on purpose! Paint your nails a fun colour. Use jewels!\\u201d advises one site pointlessly, apparently confusing our antiheroine with an eight-year-old child), she logs nervously on to online porn \\u2013 and a journey begins. Much more subtle than I\\u2019ve made it sound, at its best it\\u2019s little less than an exploration of loneliness, singledom, the raddling of a certain American dream. And there\\u2019s an intriguing subplot revolving round douchebag Brendan, as his cocky sleepwalk through high-school jockdom conquests is nastily unsettled by new college realities, and such alarmingly esoteric concepts as \\u201cconsent\\u201d.

According to the contract notice on AusTender, the health department engaged Carbon Media to provide creative services for the Covid-19 campaign on 3 March. A spokesman for the health minister Greg Hunt defended the timeline, telling Guardian Australia the department \\u201chad access to creative services from a range of sources, both internal and external, well before Carbon Media was engaged\\u201d but conceded the contract for the national campaign began on 3 March. Labor has seized on the revelation to step up its criticism that the Morrison government was too slow to educate the public about preventing the spread of coronavirus through hygiene and social distancing measures. On Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia will require all international arrivals in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days and is now encouraging social distancing for others. The escalation comes on top of a recommendation that from Monday all non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled. The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable. The $407,700 Carbon Media contract is due to run until 30 June and was awarded by limited tender, subject to the exemption on open tenders for government advertising contracts. Carbon Media has numerous other contracts with the health department including for seasonal influenza communications and childhood immunisation. Labor\\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, told Guardian Australia: \\u201cTime will tell whether this is in an effective advertising campaign, but Labor questions why it took the government over two months to commence an advertising campaign to provide the most basic public health information on Covid-19. \\u201cThey should be doing more, sooner.\\u201d The coronavirus ads, which were rolled out on Saturday, direct Australians to visit health.gov.au to access up-to-date advice: Another version of the ad urges people who have been overseas or had contact with people with coronavirus to call ahead before visiting the doctor and stay home if the illness is mild: Australians are directed to cough or sneeze into their arm or a tissue, and to wash their hands regularly: On Wednesday Hunt announced the $30m ad campaign as part of the $2.4bn health response to the coronavirus. So far, the health department has paid $2.3m to Mediabrands Australia for the media buy for the campaign, and $56,375 to Snapcracker Research and Strategy for concept testing for the campaign. Those contracts run from 12 March and 4 March. The department has paid $17,270 to Ansible Pty Ltd to develop a mobile application, although it is unclear if the contract relates to development of a new coronavirus app. At a press conference on Sunday Bowen said Labor welcomed the fact the advertising campaign has started in earnest. \\u201cI have made the point consistently that the public information has not always been clear and consistent,\\u201d he said. Bowen said the campaign \\u201cneeds to be a nationally coordinated, fully integrated campaign to allay misinformation on social media\\u201d and should also \\u201cmake people\\u2019s obligations for self-isolation very clear\\u201d. On Monday, Scott Morrison told ABC\\u2019s AM resources for the campaign were put in place \\u201cseveral weeks ago\\u201d and the government had taken coronavirus seriously since mid-January. He cited travel bans and evacuations from Wuhan, without explaining why the health campaign was commissioned on 3 March. The first case of coronavirus in Australia was confirmed on 25 January. On 11 March Hunt defended the pace of rolling out ads by noting the government had already started using signage at airports to communicate about measures to combat coronavirus. \\u201cIn addition, we\\u2019ll be focusing on online, electronic media and messages to the home to make sure that people have as many avenues [to receive information] as possible,\\u201d he said.

The new agreement will run until 2030. Immediate impacts will see players receive higher minimum salaries, improved benefits and less severe punishment for marijuana use. Rosters will increase from 53 to 55 players for each team, meaning there will be 64 more jobs for players in the league in the 2020 season. The players\\u2019 share of league income will also rise from the current 47% to as much as 48.5% by 2021. The NFL\\u2019s revenue was around $15bn in the 2018 season. While the players will be better off financially, they will now need to put their bodies under more strain. The regular season will increase from 16 to 17 games, a change which could come into effect as soon as 2021. \\u201cWe are pleased that the players have voted to ratify the proposed new CBA, which will provide substantial benefits to all current and retired players, increase jobs, ensure continued progress on player safety, and give our fans more and better football,\\u201d the NFL commissioner, Roger Goodell, said in a statement on Sunday. The new agreement was passed by a vote of 1019-959 among the members of the NFL Players\\u2019 Association. NFL team owners had already voted to approve the deal last month. Several high-profile players, including Aaron Rodgers, Russell Wilson and JJ Watt, did not agree with the deal. Rodgers has expressed his concern about the toll an additional game could take on players\\u2019 bodies. \\u201cA lot of us are wondering how the hell [the 17-game season] even got into the conversation,\\u201d the Green Bay Packers quarterback said earlier this month, \\u201cbecause nobody wanted it.\\u201d The NFLPA executive director, DeMaurice Smith, acknowledged that not all of the union\\u2019s members supported the deal but said they would benefit overall. \\u201cThe current proposal contains increases across almost every category of wages, hours, working conditions and benefits for former and current players,\\u201d he said. \\u201cLike any contested negotiation ... the proposal also reflects trades with the counterparty which have to be carefully weighed and assessed across the entirety of the deal. Please be confident that I hear loudly and clearly those of you who have passionately expressed their perspective that these gains are not enough when weighed against, for example, adding another game. That position reflects how some members have chosen to weigh what aspect of the deal is important to them.\\u201d There are also likely to be two additional playoff spots for the new season, with 14 teams making the postseason. That change was suggested by team owners and did not have to be approved by the NFLPA. The new NFL year starts on Wednesday, when teams and players can negotiate trades and free agency movement.

Despite the years-long drought that has scourged the countryside and left its once-fruitful fields bereft of greenery, Her Majesty has decreed that she will not look mercifully upon any subject who cannot render annual tribute amounting to one-10th of his harvest, though their starveling children cry themselves to sleep and the ribs of their horses cast sawtoothed shadows on the withered heath.

The move lowers borrowing costs to their crisis-era low of between 0.0% and 0.25%. In a coordinated effort to see off a potential global economic crisis, the central bank also said it was working with the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and others to smooth out disruptions in overseas markets. \\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,\\u201d the Fed\\u2019s rate-setting committee said in a statement. \\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.\\u201d But despite central bankers stepping in, airlines face a fight for survival as countries impose flight curbs. \\u201cThe shock decision to suspend flights between Europe and the US is about to take a heavy toll on the airline operators but it could be just a warm-up for what is to come now that Spain has declared a state of emergency because of the spread of Covid-19,\\u201d Matt Weller of Gain Capital said. Middle East markets, which traded on Sunday, fell broadly. Egypt\\u2019s main share index tumbled by 7%, with Dubai falling 4%. The Fed\\u2019s move could potentially stabilise markets on Monday, although further volatility looks inevitable. The sports retailer Nike is closing all its stores in the US, Western Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand for more than a week to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a reminder of the economic damage being caused. Corporate bond prices have also come under heavy pressure since the coronavirus crisis began, amid rising fears that firms will default on their debts. Bonds issued by the travel industry, such as the US car-rental company Hertz, fell sharply last week. \\u201cThis certainly is another match being lit [near] the bonfire of corporate debt liabilities,\\u201d Simon MacAdam, a global economist at Capital Economics, told CNN. \\u201cThere\\u2019s definitely potential for systemic risk.\\u201d Analysts at Nomura predict the eurozone economy will shrink by at least 1.5% in April-June and contract by 0.8% during 2020 as a whole. After three weeks of losses, some investors are looking for signs that the slump is bottoming out. But without effective, coordinated action, stocks and bonds could slide again \\u2013 potentially adding to the 29% losses suffered by the UK\\u2019s FTSE 100 so far this year. G7 leaders will hold a conference call on Monday to discuss the crisis \\u2013 a chance to agree new measures to protect their economies. But the US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, played down the suggestion the US could be falling into recession. insisting coronavirus will be a short-lived problem. \\u201cLater in the year, obviously, the economic activity will pick up as we confront this virus,\\u201d Mnuchin told ABC. The coronavirus pandemic has also hurt Saudi Arabia\\u2019s state-owned oil giant. Saudi Aramco promised to cut its spending this year to weather the coronavirus pandemic, after revealing on Sunday that its oil revenues fell by more than a fifth last year because of lower oil prices. Aramco reported a worse than expected net profit of $88.2bn (\\u00a369.9bn) in 2019, down from $111.1bn in 2018, because of lower oil prices. The world\\u2019s most profitable company said it plans to spend between $25bn to $30bn this year, down from $32.8bn last year, after the Covid-19 virus wiped out oil demand forecasts for 2020. The benchmark oil price averaged $64.26 a barrel last year, down from $71.34 a barrel the year before. The current price is below $34 a barrel and is forecast to remain low as the virus threatens a global economic recession. The oil markets recorded their steepest price drop since the 1991 Gulf war, to lows of $33 a barrel last week, after Saudi Arabia waged an oil price war against rival \\u201cpetro-nations\\u201d by vowing to ramp up oil production to record highs. The kingdom instructed Aramco last week to raise the maximum rate of oil it can comfortably produce to 13m barrels of oil a day to secure its market share against rising oil exports from Russia and the US.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 910}, {\"title\": \"Coronavirus has emptied flights. It could end up changing flying for ever\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-airlines-emptied-flights-changing-flying\", \"content\": \"As coronavirus grew from a Chinese outbreak to a global pandemic, the aviation industry was at the leading edge of the accompanying financial crisis. Since the extraordinary intercontinental travel ban imposed by President Trump last week, the disastrous potential extent of the crisis for airlines has become clear. A drop-off in demand, as businesses cut back on travel and passengers deferred holidays, is being replaced by government decrees and mandatory public health measures. If much lost trade has so far come in the quiet months for western carriers in the northern hemisphere, the prospect of losing spring and summer bookings is another scale of financial loss altogether. Already, major airlines \\u2013 even the likes of British Airways and German carrier Lufthansa, let alone the financially precarious Norwegian \\u2013 have made it clear that this is now a challenge to their very survival. The speedy escalation of the crisis, with major hubs such as Madrid now following Rome in being declared off-limits to non-essential travel, makes it impossible to predict whether this is a hiatus \\u2013 or if measures announced as temporary could last for much longer. As British Airways\\u2019 boss, Alex Cruz, told 45,000 staff on Friday, for airlines this is already bigger than the Sars epidemic, the aftermath of 9/11 or the 2008 financial crisis. In extraordinary times, the normal rules will no longer apply. Flag carriers have swiftly appealed for state aid. Layoffs could be temporary, or permanent. Already a glut of planes are mothballed. The withdrawal of most scheduled international air travel, even for a short time, no longer looks improbable as much of Europe approaches the kind of shutdown so far seen only in Italy. Indeed, the idea of shuttling vast numbers of people anywhere, let alone between infected countries, has rapidly started to look reckless. Yet it is worth noting that public transport continues to function in Italy; people still need services, food and goods. And a plane flying in Chinese medics and supplies was warmly welcomed to Rome on Friday. That flight was another reminder of how aviation remains an essential part of our world; why governments have long subsidised flag carriers, at vast expense. Last week\\u2019s emergency measures included the cancellation of international sporting fixtures \\u2013 taking away another small but significant slice of life that is dependent on air travel. But before the latest escalation, planes had been flying almost empty, with many of the dwindling numbers of passengers deciding not to show up \\u2013 something that made clear how many airline trips are entirely discretionary. Perhaps, if and when normality returns, there could be a glut of pent-up demand from societies forced to work from home or self-isolate. But airline seats are perishable goods, and most of the revenues will never be recouped; many of those who might have booked holidays can expect to see annual leave used up to care for children sent home from school, or sick relatives. Business travel that has been postponed for health fears may end up looking like an unaffordable expense for many firms, should coronavirus lead to recession. A sustained pandemic could vastly alter the industry. Far smaller shocks have caused weak airlines to go under; but even the big players are likely to have their wings clipped. The appetite for travel may be an ancient human urge, but global hypermobility is only a couple of decades old. Action on climate change may have restricted aviation; higher fares from reduced competition might yet do more. Now, societies forced to do without flying may also start to question whether the habit was worth it. Even before coronavirus, protectionism in trade and the political willingness to erect fresh borders with neighbours had re-emerged to a startling extent. A world haunted by viruses arguably needs globalised structures more than ever, but is meanwhile ever more ready to slam international doors. Airlines, so often the canary in the coalmine for the global economy, may never fly quite so high again. Saudi ruthlessness on display once more It was not so long ago that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hoped to convince the global financial community that Saudi Arabia was a respectable modern economy, home to Saudi Aramco \\u2013 the world\\u2019s most profitable listed company \\u2013 and a power broker in stabilising oil markets. But if Prince Mohammed had expected to establish a reputation as a moderniser and visionary, then waging an oil price war during a deadly pandemic might not have been his most considered move. The world\\u2019s largest oil exporter triggered the worst day in the financial markets since 1987 last week after firing the starting gun on a race to pump more oil than the global market can absorb. The benchmark price fell by its fastest rate since the 1991 Gulf war to lows not seen in four years, wiping billions from the market value of companies across the energy sector. These companies form the pillars of global equity markets, which buckled under the pressure of plummeting share prices and fears that the economic contagion of the Covid-19 virus might trigger a worldwide recession. The decision of the Saudi crown prince to wreak havoc on the global markets is both shocking and true to form. Prince Mohammed is never far from accusations of extortion, torture and even murder, all denied. If the oil market is a game of money and power, he is playing for the latter. By flooding the world with cheap Saudi oil, the kingdom will corner the global market and reassert its dominance against the rise of Russia and American shale production. It is a race Russia is willing to run, but there is no doubt that this is a race to the bottom. At least there is one constant in the markets: the ruthless impetuousness of the Saudi regime. Intu must auction off the crown jewels Shopping centre owner Intu is unlikely to last until the end of the year in its current form, despite boasting nine of the UK\\u2019s top 20 malls, including Manchester\\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex. A \\u00a32bn loss, postponement of an emergency cash call, questions about its status as a going concern, and a share price down more than 90% over the past year \\u2013 the group\\u2019s debt problems are mounting. Hovering below 5p, Intu shares can now be purchased for less than the cost of a \\u201cbag for life\\u201d in the shops that rent space in its centres. Struggling retail chains have taken their toll on Intu\\u2019s rental income, all while the shopping-centre company groans under \\u00a34.5bn of debt, compared with a market value of about \\u00a360m. For it to access its new overdraft facility in October 2021, its banks have demanded that it raise at least \\u00a31.3bn from investors. Most analysts believe Intu won\\u2019t reach that date without drastic action. The company\\u2019s management is putting on a brave face, insisting they have options. But the time for selling mid-tier assets and tinkering around the edges is over. Survival means facing up to the unpalatable \\u2013 auctioning off the crown jewels, such as the Trafford Centre. The company holds the debt for each centre in separate vehicles, rather than at group level, making any move to take Intu private costly and complex, even for an investor such as billionaire John Whittaker \\u2013 the original owner of the Trafford Centre \\u2013 who runs Peel Group, Intu\\u2019s largest shareholder. The value of Intu\\u2019s properties tumbled by 22% last year. Further falls of just 5% would see the loan-to-value ratios on some of its centres hit danger levels. If it triggers a covenant, as occurred in January with Gateshead\\u2019s Metrocentre, the banks could ask for the keys back. And this is without adding coronavirus into the mix.

Some big changes happening across the sporting landscape with doubtless more to come over the next week. We\\u2019ve already seen the end, for now, of the Super Rugby. While the AFLM, AFLW, NRL and A-League are still scheduled to go ahead next week, albeit behind closed doors, advice is changing multiple times a day and who knows if those next games will happen next week, or at all? The Newcastle Jets look pretty comfortable in Adelaide, up 3-0 halfway through the second half, while in Wollongong the Tigers have pulled ahead, leading the Dragons 18-14 with 15 minutes remaining. Until we meet again, in whatever form Sportwatch takes over the coming weeks, good night, stay safe, socially distant and clean. So long! NRL: Here\\u2019s that footage of Cameron Smith with his take on how the NRL should be handling the competition in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. NBL: The Perth Wildcats are one win away from securing the NBL premiership with a win over the Sydney Kings in game three of a best of five grand final series played behind closed doors today. NRL: Melbourne\\u2019s Cameron Smith has added his voice to the debate on continuing the NRL, believing the competition should be suspended for two weeks. More from AAP: Cam Smith calls for NRL to be suspended Cameron Smith has called for the NRL to be suspended for at least two weeks in a bid to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Smith said he was speaking for all Melbourne players when he highlighted his concern around family members and the team\\u2019s constant travel load. \\u201cThere is something in place tomorrow to avoid being around groups larger than 500 people, and there are more than 500 people at airports and we\\u2019re going to be doing that every second week,\\u201d Smith said. A-League: Adelaide 0-1 Newcastle at half-time This game was scoreless for most of the half, until Dimitrios Petratos slid it across to Roy O\\u2019Donovan for a simple tap in in the 41st minute to put the Jets ahead. Newcastle have been pretty ordinary on the road this year, so they\\u2019ll be hoping to snatch just their second away win of the season if they can see this lead through. NRL: St George-Illawarra Dragons 12-8 Wests Tigers at half-time The Dragons got the early points in this one, before the Tigers hit back. But Zac Lomax was on hand to deliver another blow for the Dragons, putting pressure on the Tigers fullback Corey Thompson that forces and error and lets Lomax sneak over for an easy try, before adding the conversion. Lomax was lucky his own error didn\\u2019t prove costly later as he dropped a simple kick return right on the Tigers\\u2019 tryline, but the Dragons defence was good enough to hold the Tigers out. Despite West Coast finally managing to snare a goal in the final quarter, this game was all about the Gold Coast Suns. It was a dominant display from start to finish and keeps their finals hopes alive going into their match against Adelaide next week. Kalinda Howarth continued her form into the final quarter, finishing with four goals for the game. \\u201cIt was an awesome game today,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe love playing in the dry - it was a really great opportunity to show off our skills. It was awesome to be able to get on the board and hopefully we can keep pushing through and keep winning.\\u201d Just a reminder that if you want a quick rundown of everything that\\u2019s happening in Australian sport with regards to coronavirus, this story has all the latest updates. AFLW: Gold Coast leads West Coast 4.3 (27) to 0.2 (2) The Suns have really started to assert their dominance on this game, with some impressive stats coming out of their side of the scorecard. Jacqui Yorston has been a menace in defence, with nine tackles and eight disposals, while Kate Surman with 17 disposals is working like a machine. Kalinda Howarth has been on fire with the boot, kicking three of the Suns\\u2019 four goals. Rugby Sevens: Here is more on that story I mentioned earlier about possible coronavirus cases coming out of the Australian Sevens camp, via AAP. Australian Sevens program possibly hit by virus Two members of the Australian sevens program have been tested for coronavirus after showing signs and symptoms associated with the pandemic. Rugby Australia didn\\u2019t specify whether they were players or staff, only announcing two people had self-isolated after experiencing symptoms this weekend. Both had attended the RA high performance centre within its Moore Park headquarters in Sydney during the past week. As a precautionary measure, the governing body\\u2019s headquarters will be closed for two days for an intensive clean. All administrative staff have been advised to work from home, and the Australian men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s sevens teams will not attend the facility on Monday or Tuesday. Results of the tests are expected to be known within 72 hours. The Phoenix finished off their last home game for the forseeable future in style, with a 3-0 takedown of the Victory in Wellington. A second half goal to David Ball sealed the deal and their defence held strong to deny the Victory any goals. It was a measured performance that will see them edge ever closer to Melbourne City on the ladder, sitting just outside the top two. Rugby Sevens: An interesting little piece of info from Georgina Robinson on Twitter here, we\\u2019ll keep an eye on this story and see how it progresses. Well I predicted someone would blink before too long in the second half and it was Manly in the end - Melbourne were able to score the first try of the game in the 61st minute with a little chip over the top to winger Suliasi Vunivalu. Two minutes later Vunivalu was over again and Tom Eisenhuth put the icing on the cake in the 74th minute. An ominous start to the season for the Sea Eagles, who tend to rely on their parochial home crowd to get them over the line at their Brookvale fortress. The crowd couldn\\u2019t do it today and from next week they will be unable to even get through the gates. AFLW: Gold Coast 2.2 (14) leads West Coast 0.1 (1) at half-time Things aren\\u2019t getting any better for the Eagles, with still no goals on the board. It hasn\\u2019t been a complete performance from the Suns so far, but they\\u2019ve done enough to stay on top and will be feeling pretty confident heading into the sheds for half-time. A huge win for the Brumbies as the Super Rugby grinds to a halt while travel restrictions are enacted. Seven tries for the home side in this game, while the Waratahs couldn\\u2019t manage to score again in the second half. Tom Banks scores an absolute belter at the death just to really send the Waratahs home with their tails between their legs. The Brumbies are comfortably on top of the Australian conference, while the Waratahs are languishing down near the bottom, just ahead of the Sunwolves. Formula One: Giles Richards\\u2019 fascinating chat with former world champion Alan Jones (not the one from the radio) is well worth a read, some interesting thoughts on the Albert Park cancellation. Jones was hugely disappointed at the cancellation but accepts it was the right thing to do. The indomitable Australian can-do spirit tempered by the reality of the coronavirus. \\u2018From my point of view I would have gone ahead and done it anyway but you have to be sensible about the whole thing,\\u2019 he says.\\u201d AFLW: Gold Coast leads West Coast 1.2 (8) to 0.0 (0) at quarter-time A defensive-heavy game so far, with Kalinda Howarth sneaking through a goal in the 11th minute after a couple of behinds from her teammates. A very unhappy outing from the Eagles so far, with plenty of tackling but no reward. A-League: Phoenix 2-0 Victory at half-time The Phoenix are making the most of what will likely be their last game in New Zealand for some time. They have been clinical this first half, taking their scoring opportunities and limiting Victory\\u2019s time in possession. Ulises D\\u00e1vila scored early for the home team, with Gary Hooper heading through the second in the 21st minute. A-League: An update via AAP on the situation with the Wellington Phoenix with travel restrictions coming into effect from tonight. Phoenix commit to Australian A-League stay Wellington have committed to playing out their A-League season in Australia, even though it means undergoing a self-isolation period after border restrictions introduced to Australia to combat coronavirus. With doubt surrounding the continuation of the league, the Phoenix are proposing to spend at least six-straight weeks in Australia in pursuit of a maiden title. Wellington will host Melbourne Victory on Sunday at Sky Stadium, hours before travel restrictions take effect at midnight on both sides of the Tasman. Phoenix general manager David Dome said his third-placed team had all but bought into playing out their campaign on Australian soil under extraordinary circumstances. They couldn\\u2019t play for 14 days while undergoing mandatory isolation, and then would have an intense run of games, probably in empty stadiums. Wellington would be unable to play road games scheduled next week, against Sydney FC on Wednesday and Newcastle on Sunday. They would bank on FFA rescheduling both games, while two matches - which were to have been played in Wellington in April - would need to be relocated to Australia. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want to capitulate and not play out. We had to play out; we had to do our best to get into the finals series,\\u201d Dome said. \\u201cThe disappointing thing for us is that the fans won\\u2019t be there to enjoy it.\\u201d Dome said the team would likely self-isolate in central Sydney accommodation and emerge only for controlled training sessions. Dome said players would have the choice to commit to a full Australian stay of at least six weeks. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to force players to go. We won\\u2019t mandate it because there are some players with families. There are some players who are expecting children and do we really want to take them away from their newborn babies?\\u201d Super Rugby: Brumbies 21-14 Waratahs at half-time Meanwhile in the code where trying scoring is usually much less frequent, there has been a bit of a try-fest down in Canberra in a high scoring first half between these two old foes. The Waratahs got on the board first through Rob Simmons, but the Brumbies hit back soon after and lead three tries to two. Solomone Kata managed two in eight minutes for the home side. With the Super Rugby suspended after today when travel restrictions into Australia and New Zealand come into place, this will be an important win to get. NRL: Manly 4-2 Melbourne at half-time A very low scoring start to the season for these two teams with the match resembling rugby union more than league - three penalty goals are all that has troubled the scorers in the first half. Both sides have been phenomenal in the defence of their lines, but early season lack of fitness is likely to plague one or both sides in the second half and we could see some late tries sneak through. A strong win for GWS over last year\\u2019s premiers, sending them into second place on the Conference A ladder. Another goal from Cora Staunton sealed the deal as they kept up their defence all the way to the end. A late goal from Courtney Gum for the Crows wasn\\u2019t enough to bridge the gap and the Giants celebrated the win. An emotional response from Staunton showed just how important this game was to the GWS team. \\u201cObviously it was a big game for the club,\\u201d said Staunton after the match. \\u201cWe knew coming in it was a big game for the club...it was a massive win for us. We wanted consistency in our game and we showed that today. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing that there\\u2019s no crowd, but we obviously understand that people\\u2019s health is a lot more important than sport. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been just over 10 months since I shattered my leg and had four breaks. I didn\\u2019t know if I\\u2019d be back...it was a physical and mental battle to get back.\\u201d More perspective on cancellations, this time out of the UK from Barney Ronay. There will be a clashing of gears over all this and no shortage of legal threats as time and resources are divvied up. Sport will survive. The beauty, the grace, the basic pleasure of these gaudy entertainments will remain unaffected. But a great deal of practical help will be required to ensure it is not offered only to those victims of this nasty little bug who can shout the loudest, that precarious livelihoods and the infrastructure of amateur sport are also protected.\\u201d AFLW: GWS leads Adelaide 3.2 (20) to 2.3 (15) at three-quarter time Another low scoring quarter - the stifling defence from the Giants is doing the job here as they keep their noses in front. It\\u2019s an exhausting style of game to play though, so it will be interesting to see how their fitness holds up in the last quarter. Alyce Parker is doing a power of work, with 25 disposals and six marks to her name. Brittany Tully scored the goal to ease the Giants ahead, just four minutes before three-quarter time. W-League: The match report on Melbourne City\\u2019s dominant semi-final win is up now. Some good info here from Tom Kludt on the North American perspective of sport in the time of coronavirus and those who will be hit hardest by league suspensions. Schauder says the deepest, and most immediate implications, will be felt by those employed by the stadiums, which play host to other entertainment ventures along with sporting events, as well as nearby businesses that capitalize on those gatherings.\\u201d AFLW: GWS leads Adelaide 2.2 (14) to 2.1 (13) As predicted, this game remains a tight struggle, with just one goal that quarter - to the Giants\\u2019 cross-coder Jodie Hicks (also a cricketer with the Sydney Sixers in the WBBL). Last season\\u2019s best and fairest for the Giants Rebecca Beeson has continued her dominance, with 10 disposals and three tackles for the match. Strong defence from the Giants is frustrating the Crows, the team in orange will need to keep that up and continue to stifle as the match plays out. F1: A bit of a mess this week with the cancellation of the F1 after all spectators had arrived and were waiting to get in. Giles Richards breaks it down for us in this story. It was merely mismanagement that had crowned what increasingly appears to have been at best an optimistic decision to bring thousands of F1 personnel from a Europe already creaking under the assault of coronavirus to a mass gathering event that attracts up to 100,000 people a day. In the light of sport across the world curtailing activity to restrict the spread of the virus, that F1 felt it could escape unscathed seems hopelessly naive.\\u201d AFLW: Adelaide 2.1 (13) lead GWS 1.1 (7) at quarter time A strong first quarter from the Crows with Courtney Gum and Marijana Rajcic in the goals. Cora Staunton scored for GWS, who will feel that they are still in the game at this point. Tait Mackrill and Rebecca Beeson have both been strong for the Giants, with plenty of disposals in the first quarter. It\\u2019s shaping up to be a cracker of a game. City have booked their spot in the W-League grand final with a decisive win over the Wanderers. Kyah Simon was happy with the performance and said the team is focusing on improving to ensure they play their best game in the grand final against Sydney FC next weekend. \\u201cI\\u2019ve played with a lot of the Sydney FC girls and spent a lot of my career there in the sky blue,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPriority is to play our own game and focus on what we do well.\\u201d Interesting to see elbow bumps taking place between the two teams after the game considering the level of the goal celebrations taking place. Possibly each team believes they could only spread viruses through opposition and not teammates? A-League: News just in from AAP on the potential suspension of the A-League: Travel restrictions could shut A-League The A-League could be suspended with the governments of Australia and New Zealand imposing compulsory 14-day self-isolation periods to combat the coronavirus. Wellington Phoenix will host Melbourne Victory at Sky Stadium on Sunday, with travel restrictions taking effect in Australia and New Zealand at midnight. On Saturday following New Zealand announcing its health plan, the Phoenix said it would be \\u201cimpossible\\u201d to host matches at home due to international travellers having to self-isolate for two weeks. Well in this very strange week the coverage of sport has looked quite different to usual. This interesting piece from Jonathan Liew talks about sport bringing the brutal reality of coronavirus to the front of many people\\u2019s minds. For so many of us, sport isn\\u2019t simply a way of passing the time but a way of marking it. It offers a liturgy, a structure on which to measure the passing days and seasons...In frightening times, virus or no virus, these are the rituals that offer the veneer of normality, a background noise as reassuring and immutable as the ticking of the clock.\\u201d Not a happy outing for the Brumbies, being comprehensively beaten by the Reds in Canberra. The Reds were dominant in every facet of the game and with this win, have earned the right to host next weekend\\u2019s Super W playoff. Tries to Shannon Mato, Okeroa Manihera and Ivy Kaleta sealed the win for the Reds, with a 100% conversion rate from Lori Cramer. This swung back and forth like a pendulum and was very close throughout most of the match, but in the end the Dockers were able to put the foot down and come away with a strong 15 point win. Ashley Sharp was dominant for Fremantle, kicking three goals, while Mia-Rae Clifford finished with two. It was a valiant effort from the Bulldogs who are well down the Conference B ladder, taking it to the highly fancied Dockers who remained undefeated at the top of Conference B. NRL: An interesting story from AAP on potential responses the NRL are considering. NRL take advice from biosecurity expert ARL commission chairman Peter V\\u2019landys has revealed a north Queensland resort has reached out to the NRL to be considered if all 16 clubs are to be relocated to play a \\u2018Magic Round\\u2019 style competition. As NRL bosses navigate one of the most complex challenges in the game\\u2019s history due to the coronavirus pandemic, V\\u2019landys has confirmed every option to keep the competition alive is being considered. That includes relocating all 16 NRL teams to a warmer climate such as Queensland where the virus is less likely to thrive, isolating teams in one location, and playing all games at one stadium to ensure the broadcast can proceed. A resort in far north Queensland has already emailed the NRL to advise they have vacancies to accommodate all 16 NRL teams should the competition be moved. However, it all hinges on a report from an appointed biosecurity expert who will assess which solution is safest for players. \\u201cWe need to get our biosecurity experts to have a look at that facility and how we would eliminate any risk. There\\u2019s an element of thought that you might put greater risk by having all the players in one area,\\u201d V\\u2019landys told Triple M on Sunday. \\u201cWe have to look at all contingencies and ensure that we are providing the best biosecurity measures to eliminate any risk of the players catching the virus. The biggest risk for us is a player or official catching the virus, which means there would be isolation of some of the players and teams and that\\u2019s when we can pull the lever on suspending the season.\\u201d Other options understood to be considered are postponing the season for a month and extending the competition through until the end of October and playing catch-up games during bye rounds. There is also the option for rescheduling games should a player be diagnosed with coronavirus and restructuring the competition for games to be played later in the season. Games are already closed to crowds from round two but conversations will continue with clubs over the next week as the global situation remains fluid. It\\u2019s still to be determined if lower grade and junior competitions will need to be shut down, with the state authorities to make those decisions in the coming days. However, V\\u2019landys said it was inevitable there would be changes made. Coronavirus updates: Head to this story if you want to keep track of where Australian sports are at with postponing, cancelling and locking out spectators as the coronavirus continues to have an effect on sport around the world. We\\u2019ll keep it updated throughout the day as information comes in and situations change. W-League: Melbourne City 3-0 Western Sydney Wanderers at half-time A big half for City who have all but booked their place in the grand final after a dominant first half. Goals from Kyah Simon, Claire Emslie and Rebekah Stott put City on the board, though the goal celebrations were not entirely in keeping with social distancing protocols - it will be interesting to see how this trends across sport this weekend. Well, what a weekend this is. At this stage we have plenty of live sport to get through, although many sports are locked out to crowds. But today may be the last day we see this much sport for a while - the Super Rugby will be postponed at the conclusion of the current round following travel restrictions to New Zealand coming into effect tonight. The NRL is continuing with round two at this stage, though crowds will be locked out after the conclusion of round one this evening. The Super Netball has cancelled the Team Girls Cup preseason competition that was due to be held from 27-29 March. It\\u2019s certainly not the usual Sportwatch for a weekend - I\\u2019ll do my best to keep you updated on all the latest developments as they unfold.

The escalating public health crisis has played havoc with all areas of US life, but Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio will still go to the polls on Tuesday. After his spectacular rebound on Super Tuesday and strong performances this week, Biden is ahead in delegates earned, seemingly on course for the nomination to face Donald Trump in November. But Sanders has refused to throw in the towel, saying this week that though he may be \\u201closing the debate over electability\\u201d, he is a champion for the views of most younger voters and wants to influence the general election platform. \\u201cOn Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,\\u201d Sanders said, indicating he would challenge the former vice-president on healthcare reform, the minimum wage and other progressive priorities. Nick Carter, Sanders\\u2019 political outreach director in 2016, told the New York Times the Vermont senator was \\u201cpivoting to ensure that the issues that he has built his political career around continue to be front and center in the political dialogue. \\u201cI also think he has [at the] top of [his] mind ensuring his supporters and those unenthusiastic about a Biden candidacy don\\u2019t call it a day.\\u201d Many in the Democratic establishment would prefer the independent from Vermont admit defeat and put his shoulder to the wheel for Biden. In emails to the Guardian, Martin O\\u2019Malley, a former Baltimore mayor, Maryland governor and candidate for the presidential nomination, said he was \\u201cguessing, most kindly, that Bernie is thinking as quickly as Biden sprung back to political life, he could as easily stumble and so he has an obligation to hang in there. \\u201cWhat he risks is that more and more people [see] his messiah veneer fall away and his hypocrisy on many issues \\u2013 gun safety, immigration reform, Russia interference \\u2013 will strip away his lovable old uncle persona.\\u201d At the polls, Biden\\u2019s comeback from seemingly inevitable defeat has been powered by older voters, moderates, voters in swing counties and an overwhelming percentage of African Americans. \\u201cI think Biden has been so battered and scarred already,\\u201d O\\u2019Malley said, \\u201c[that] I\\u2019m not sure there is much more that Bernie can do \\u2026 in fact, Bernie could be a useful foil for Biden\\u2019s need to appeal to and win more independents.\\u201d Reed Galen, a former aide to George W Bush and John McCain, left the Republican party in 2016 and is now part of the Lincoln Project, a super Pac devoted to producing ads against Trump. Sanders is \\u201cusing the core of his support base to not drop out gracefully\\u201d, Galen told the Guardian on Saturday, adding: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think Bernie Sanders has grace about him. From my perspective I think he should have [dropped out] and let the Biden campaign go and do the things it needs to do vis-a-vis Trump. \\u201cBut Bernie doesn\\u2019t care because he\\u2019s not a Democrat and never has been, so from his supporters\\u2019 perspective, if they wreck the Democratic party it\\u2019s just another win for them.\\u201d Galen and O\\u2019Malley both expected a fiery contest in CNN\\u2019s Washington studio. \\u201cBiden won\\u2019t stand there like a punching bag,\\u201d said O\\u2019Malley, who experienced the highs and lows of the debate stage alongside Sanders and Hillary Clinton. \\u201cHe will hit back when pressed. And Bernie has no choice but to press.\\u201d Galen said he thought Biden had a good opportunity to appeal again to moderates and independents, but added a warning about the pitfalls of any such bare-knuckle political bout, into which Biden has fallen in this and other elections. \\u201cWhen you hit that debate stage it\\u2019s like a roller coaster heading downhill,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou hope it\\u2019s going to stay on the tracks but once in a while it goes flying off the edge.\\u201d The coronavirus outbreak \\u2013 which caused Univision host Jorge Ramos to step aside as a debate host after contact with someone exposed to Covid-19 \\u2013 seems sure to dominate proceedings. Both Biden and Sanders addressed the nation on the subject this week, attempting to present a contrast with Trump\\u2019s wildly uneven attempts to lead. Galen said he thought Biden\\u2019s advisers would therefore seek to \\u201cutilise what Biden has been best at, which is relying on personal experience. \\u201cWe saw this week that he started talking about what he\\u2019s done in government and what government can and can\\u2019t do. I think his team will try to stay in that fairly narrow zone. \\u201cBut it wouldn\\u2019t surprise me if they also spend a fair amount of time focused on Trump. Here\\u2019s a way that he can use a sledgehammer on Trump but a scalpel on Sanders: by saying, \\u2018Here\\u2019s a guy we elected that had no experience, no people willing to work for him, no people he is willing to listen to. We can\\u2019t have that anymore.\\u2019\\u201d Galen and O\\u2019Malley both deplored a tweet sent by Trump\\u2019s campaign this week which called Biden a \\u201crotting corpse of a candidate\\u201d, and said it was a taste of the fierce and dirty fight to come. \\u201cThere is one question and only one question that viewers will be asking themselves during Sunday\\u2019s debate,\\u201d O\\u2019Malley said, \\u201cand it is this: which of these two candidates would do the best job of keeping me and my family safe in a big emergency, like, a pandemic. \\u201cWhat I do know is that of the three men left [including Trump], more and more people are wishing Biden were already in charge.\\u201d In fact, the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still campaigning.

Perhaps \\u2013 because most vegetables are annuals \\u2013 it is the promise of faster results. Or maybe it\\u2019s down to perceived cost \\u2013 after all, vegetable seeds are far cheaper to buy than fruit bushes or trees. Or maybe it\\u2019s just that people are put off by all the complex pruning rules\\u2026 However, if it is maximum reward for minimum cost and in minimum space that you are after, fruit beats vegetables hands down by almost every measure. For starters, most fruit bushes are perennial, so will come back year after year without significant extra cost or effort. Add this to the fact that, generally, their harvests cost more to buy, too. So, with this in mind, here\\u2019s my take on the best fruiting plants for small patches, all of which you can plant right now. If you are looking for the easiest of all fruit to grow, it would be hard to find a better example than the wild strawberry. Containing a whopping five times the sugar of the traditional cultivated variety, plus a far heftier dose of aroma compounds, each tiny fruit is so intensely flavoured, it\\u2019s like biting into living confectionary. Unlike regular strawberries, they don\\u2019t produce those pesky runners that need constant trimming or replanting, either. They will even fruit well in shady spaces where most fruit plants would not be happy. As their fruit are, at best, thumbnail-sized, you will need to plant quite a few to get a decent harvest. However, considering they are extremely cheap to propagate from seed (each packet will produce 100 plants or more) and can be crammed in as underplanting in any gap in a bed, pot or border, this is surprisingly easy to do. Sticking with berries that grow well in shade, raspberries are an excellent candidate, too. A new generation of dwarf varieties means you can grow them easily even if all you have are pots. \\u2018Ruby Falls\\u2019 has to be the best contender here, producing good yields on plants no more than 1m high. They don\\u2019t have thorns or require staking, either, which is a real godsend. If you have a little more space to play with, the weird, purple-coloured fruit of \\u2018Glen Coe\\u2019 have a wonderful fusion of classic blackberry and raspberry flavour. They grow on thornless, silvery blue stems. They are vigorous and will grow fairly tall without a few snips of the secateurs, but they will happily live in a 1m-wide border without spreading laterally. Lastly, I have to give a shout out to the boysenberry, probably the least grown of the traditional berries, yet undoubtedly the tastiest. This complex, intergenerational hybrid of a range of different bramble species, including both raspberries, blackberries and more exotic species like the American dewberry, is essentially unbuyable in supermarkets due to its short shelf life and low yields. But it has a flavour, both in terms of aromatic intensity and sweetness, like no other. It\\u2019s as if someone injected them with blackberry jam and raspberry cordial. There are now thornless varieties, too, and none will take up much room. I\\u2019d say it was an absolute must-grow.

On Sunday, the number of cases of Covid-19 across Spain stood at 7,753 and 288 deaths. One week ago, Spain stood at 589 confirmed cases and 10 deaths. Echoing measures taken by Italy \\u2013 Europe\\u2019s hardest hit country \\u2013 the Spanish government declared a state of emergency on Saturday, ordering the closure of all non-essential shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes, football grounds and cinemas. Residents have been ordered to stay at home, allowed out only to buy food and medicine or travel to work, health centres or banks. Travel is also allowed for those looking after the elderly or dependents. Save for a handful of people walking their dogs or picking up groceries, most streets in Madrid were empty. \\u201cIt\\u2019s shocking,\\u201d said Bertrand Martinez Pe\\u00f1alver as he looked out at a quiet boulevard. \\u201cSpain is a place where there are always people out. Now there\\u2019s nobody.\\u201d Forced to wear a mask and winter gloves by his mother, the high-school student had been sent out to pick up bread. \\u201cI can\\u2019t be inside all day,\\u201d he said with a sigh. Food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations and pet supply shops are among the businesses that will be allowed to remain open during the next fortnight. In Madrid, police cars slowly made their way down the empty streets, using megaphones to blast out a pre-recorded message warning residents to stay indoors for their security. A few joggers, out on their own to capitalise on the sunny day, were sent home promptly by police. The Spanish government on Saturday said that Bego\\u00f1a G\\u00f3mez, the wife of the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\\u00e1nchez, had tested positive for Covid-19. Both are in good health, the government added. Two ministers in the Spanish government, Irene Montero and Carolina Darias, have also tested positive in recent days. In Barcelona, the streets of the old city were abandoned by all but the homeless and the occasional dog walker. Usually at this time of year the city is teeming with tourists but by Friday afternoon the last Segways and rickshaws had been locked away and museums, galleries and other tourist attractions shuttered, forcing the few tourists to stay in their hotels and watch TV. Road traffic had all but disappeared from Barcelona, sparking improvements in air quality and reports that the atmospheric levels of nitrous dioxide (NO2) have fallen by as much as 80%. For many, the main anxiety seemed to be whether the state of emergency would stretch beyond the initial two weeks announced by the government. Business school student Ana Murillo had just started a work placement at a consultancy in Barcelona. The placement is an integral part of the course in marketing that she has nearly completed. \\u201cThe first thing they did when the lockdown was announced was to get rid of the interns,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was supposed to finish by August but now I don\\u2019t know. The university is shut but they are saying we still have to sit our exams in May.\\u201d She hoped to be able to do some of her work placement from home, she added. Across the country, rumblings of the impending lockdown had sent people rushing to supermarkets, piling their shopping trolleys high with jars of preserves, frozen food as well as toilet paper in preparation. By Sunday, things had calmed considerably in the southern city of Seville, said Ramon Rodriguez Marquez. \\u201cI went to buy bread this morning and everyone was keeping a metre of distance between them and entering the bakery one by one. It was the same in the gas station.\\u201d The sharp rise in the number of infections forced Seville to cancel one of its tourist main draws \\u2013 the sombre Easter processions that normally wind their way through the city. The decision was a blow to the local tourism industry, sending booking plummeting and leaving many anxious to see how the government plans to deal with the economic fallout, said Rodriguez Marquez. While most people across the country were resigned to complying with the lockdown, many worried that the measures had come too late, pointing to the huge rallies that had been allowed to go ahead across the country to mark International Women\\u2019s Day as well as a 9,000-strong rally for far-right Vox party last week. \\u201cLast Sunday, this area where I live was total mayhem with thousands and thousands and thousands of people on the street,\\u201d said Eric Steinhauser as he looked out on the vacant streets below his apartment in Madrid\\u2019s city centre. \\u201cAnd I can\\u2019t believe the government had no inkling, from what happened in Italy, that this was going to be an explosive situation.\\u201d Now he wondered how the lockdown would play out in a country where everyone is accustomed to spending most of their days outsid. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how the divorce statistics will be two months from now,\\u201d he said with a laugh.\\u201dBecause when everybody is locked into the same house \\u2026 they\\u2019re going to be fighting like cats and dogs.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 8, \"content_len\": 871}, {\"title\": \"TV tonight: Julian Fellowes' tale of nouveau riche London\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/15/tv-tonight-julian-fellowes-tale-of-nouveau-riche-london\", \"content\": \"Belgravia 9pm, ITV Julian Fellowes scripts this adaptation of his 2016 novel on the lives of London\\u2019s 19th-century nouveau riche.

To some surprise, the man who said that is addressing the emergency in a more mature fashion than many anticipated when it first began to unfold. Boris Johnson has abandoned the \\u201cinvisible man\\u201d act for which I mocked him a fortnight ago and located the serious side of his character. The pantomime Johnson has been retired from public spectacle and replaced with the sombre Johnson we now see at news conferences. At his most recent, he struck an appropriately sober tone when he warned: \\u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\\u201d, words prime ministers usually don\\u2019t expect to utter outside wartime. Candour, not a quality always associated with this prime minister, is essential. Fear, panic and conspiracy theories are fomented when people suspect that their leaders are not telling them the truth. The Opinium poll that we publish today suggests that more people than not have confidence in the government\\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the margin is not a very solid one. The prime minister has been flattered by comparison with Donald Trump. His multiple flaws are being pitilessly highlighted by a crisis that a man who does not believe in scientific evidence or international cooperation is hopelessly ill-equipped to handle. Variously dismissing the coronavirus as \\u201ca hoax\\u201d cooked up by his opponents to deny him re-election or no worse than the flu, he has swung from juvenile denialism to blaming it on foreigners and Democrats. Then he suddenly announced travel bans and declared a \\u201cnational emergency\\u201d. The ineffable American president is the quintessential example of a stretch of world history in which populist blowhards have prospered at the ballot box by stoking division, promoting polarisation, scorning expertise and championing ignorance. This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \\u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \\u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise. If it does, that will be bad for populist hucksters more generally. Mr Johnson has often aped Trumpian populism when he has seen political advantage in doing so, but he is smart enough to grasp that something more grown up is now required. People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \\u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them. The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \\u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \\u201cflattening the peak\\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \\u201cwhatever it takes\\u2026 millions or billions\\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place. There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours. That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus. The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \\u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched. Sir Patrick has lucidly explained what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not trivial,\\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \\u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\\u201d Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one. Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \\u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing. \\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 1451}, {\"title\": \"Pence Unveils Campaign To Educate Teens About Dangers Of Premarital Eye Contact\", \"url\": \"https://politics.theonion.com/pence-unveils-campaign-to-educate-teens-about-dangers-o-1825592281\", \"content\": \"Emphasizing the importance of providing young people with the skills they need to make good decisions as they mature into adulthood, Vice President Mike Pence held a press conference Thursday to unveil a new campaign educating teens about the dangers of premarital eye contact. \\u201cThis new initiative will teach our nation\\u2019s teenagers the importance of waiting until marriage before looking their partner directly in the eyes,\\u201d said Pence, adding that the $75 million \\u201cNo Peeking\\u201d\\u2014also known as \\u201cSave Your Gaze For Marriage\\u201d\\u2014campaign will help students resist the social pressure to share glances they often feel long before they\\u2019re ready to be joined for life in holy matrimony. \\u201cThanks to the encroaching secular influence of TV, the movies, and, for all we know, the internet as well, today\\u2019s young people are constantly bombarded with images of people gazing shamelessly at each other\\u2014sometimes even making prolonged eye contact with more than one person.

As the number of US coronavirus cases continues to swell, both government authorities and private concerns have taken steps to foster \\u201csocial distancing\\u201d. Various US states and cities have enacted policies that limit close contact between people, in an attempt to slow this fast-moving outbreak; some of these mandates have included closing schools, prohibiting large gatherings, and limiting patrons at restaurants and bars. New York\\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, ordered the closure of all Broadway shows until 13 April. Meanwhile, the National Basketball League suspended its season, as did Major League Soccer, National Hockey League and Major League Baseball. Performances and cultural events have been put off, as have some political rallies. Businesses across the US are increasingly encouraging their employees to work from home, as happened with Stafford\\u2019s place of employ. These measures don\\u2019t just keep people apart: they inevitably keep them from going out, requiring them to keep busy at home. \\u201cI have at least 10 books I\\u2019ve never read and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Oh, this will come in really handy,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was planning to start a drawing class in April, because I\\u2019ve always wanted to get into painting.

It\\u2019s different for men: Ernest Hemingway got away with having a houseful of them. \\u201cCat Lady\\u201d, conversely, is an identity, \\u201cthe epitome of sad and lonely female failure\\u201d. Maddicott only partially explores the roots of these negative associations, nodding to pagan deities and magical familiars while devoting the bulk of her book to \\u201corphan\\u201d images of cats and their female owners, vintage photographs found in junk shops and online auction sites. From the spectral to the plain kitsch, each prompts a fanciful meditation on the forms that this unique bond takes. Saving Missy Beth Morrey HarperCollins, pp384, \\u00a312.99 Millicent Carmichael may be 79 years old but this cosy debut novel is a bildungsroman nonetheless. Having never put her Cambridge University degree to use, surrendering instead to motherhood and the careful tending of a scholarly husband, Missy now spends her days in \\u201cgalactic isolation\\u201d, drifting around her cavernous Stoke Newington home in her nightie, knocking back the sherry as she moons over faded photo albums, until a chance encounter offers a path to happiness. Key to her transformation is Bobby, the \\u201cmad mongrel\\u201d of a mutt she\\u2019s pressured into caring for. Morrey signposts her tale\\u2019s mysteries a little too obviously, but it builds up an affable momentum as it swings between hope and melancholy, and a smattering of ancient Greek adds character. Where the Hornbeam Grows Beth Lynch Weidenfeld, pp288, \\u00a38.99 When Beth Lynch\\u2019s husband was offered a job in Switzerland, the time seemed right for a fresh adventure: she\\u2019d just left a career as an Eng lit lecturer, they spoke French and German, and there were no children to uproot.

Planting anemones, aquilegias and hellebore, sedums and rudbeckia, she slowly transforms the grounds of their cottage in the dark-wooded hills of the Jura. Fusing memoir with travelogue and horticulture, this enchanting paean to green-fingered solace touches on topics from globalisation to inheritance, eschewing the indulgent excesses of nature writing in favour of a crisp lyricism and frequent bursts of drollery. \\u2022 To order Cat Women, Saving Missy or Where the Hornbeam Grows, go to guardianbookshop. com.

Set in rural Ireland, and boasting something of the \\u201cWest Country western\\u201d flavour of Sam Peckinpah\\u2019s Cornish epic Straw Dogs, it\\u2019s a fable of failed fathers and false families, unflinching in its depiction of grim realities, but laced with a redemptive transcendence that reminded me of Andrew Haigh\\u2019s Lean on Pete, or Chlo\\u00e9 Zhao\\u2019s The Rider. Cosmo Jarvis (unrecognisable from his magnetic turn in Lady Macbeth) delivers a performance of few words but hugely eloquent physicality as Douglas \\u201cArm\\u201d Armstrong, combining the powerhouse presence of Matthias Schoenaerts in Bullhead with the broken-boxer vulnerability of Jason Patric in After Dark, My Sweet. Having been traumatised \\u2013 both physically and mentally \\u2013 as a brutal youth in the ring, Arm took what looked like an escape route, becoming an enforcer for the notorious Devers clan. He calls them \\u201cmy family\\u201d, but he\\u2019s more like their attack dog, answering to the clicks and whistles (\\u201cthere\\u2019s a good boy\\u201d) of Barry Keoghan\\u2019s insidiously bullying Dympna. We meet Arm delivering a gruelling beating that will notably fail to satisfy the Deverses\\u2019 blood lust, with fatal consequences. Yet beneath the knuckles and muscles, Arm (who was \\u201ca violent child\\u201d) is riddled with insecurities, particularly concerning his ex-girlfriend Ursula (Niamh Algar) and their young son, Jack (Kiljan Tyr Moroney), a five-year-old with autism whose equine-therapy sessions inspire the film\\u2019s enigmatic title. Ursula wants to move to Cork, where she has found a school that can attend to Jack\\u2019s needs. But Arm is in no hurry to aid their departure, still clinging to his dreams of becoming a good father. Juxtaposing flashes of lens-flared sunlight with empty daytime greys and hellish nocturnal black and red hues, Calm With Horses uses a bold colour palette to accentuate the quasi-mythical themes of its seemingly down-to-earth story. There\\u2019s something genuinely demonic about Ned Dennehy\\u2019s Paudi, the foul red-eyed apparition at the heart of the Devers family who becomes Arm\\u2019s tormentor-in-chief. Yet like Ben Wheatley, Rowland places such horrors cheek-by-jowl with absurdist kitchen-sink comedy, with Hector (David Wilmot) channelling the spirit of Father Ted\\u2019s Dermot Morgan as he attempts to ingratiate himself with a wealthy widow, while keeping inconvenient familial nastiness at a polite distance. As for Arm, his life is divided between the unfeeling brutality of his job and the clumsy empathy that is starting to make him pull his punches. A scene in which he struggles helplessly to calm one of Jack\\u2019s screaming fits suggests that he has no handle on his son\\u2019s experience, yet it also chimes with an opening voiceover suggesting that father and son have long been locked in the same struggle. No wonder Arm winds up briefly riding the horse that has helped to calm Jack, suggesting that this destructive cycle \\u2013 this legacy of attempting to make sense of the world through violence \\u2013 could perhaps be broken. \\u201cThis isn\\u2019t you,\\u201d Arm is told as he does the Deverses\\u2019 bidding, a phrase echoed in Ursula\\u2019s heartbreaking declaration that \\u201cyou remind me of you sometimes \\u2026 you know, I miss you\\u201d. Buoyed by Joe Murtagh\\u2019s screenplay, which keeps the warring elements of the narrative elegantly balanced throughout, the excellent ensemble cast create a complex emotional ecosystem through which our troubled antihero stumbles in search of his identity. Cinematographer Piers McGrail contrasts broad landscape vistas with claustrophobic interiors, and even injects a Friedkin-esque sense of reckless energy into a down-and-dirty car chase, which unexpectedly pumps up the third act. Meanwhile, a superb electronic score by Blanck Mass (aka Benjamin John Power) gets right under the skin of the drama, lending an edge of frayed distortion to melancholy melodies, capturing the film\\u2019s blend of roughness and innocence. Like Daniel Lopatin\\u2019s pulsing accompaniment to the Safdie brothers\\u2019 Uncut Gems, the score for Calm With Horses seems to inject itself into the bloodstream of the central characters, helping us to see the world through their eyes, and share their often fractured experiences.

The Covid-19 virus is a member of the coronavirus family that made the jump from animals to humans late last year. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans \\u2013 current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus\\u2019s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, including the UK, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic. How can I stop myself and others from getting infected? Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and do this often, including when you get home or into work. Use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available. Avoid touching your face. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or the crook of your elbow (not your hand) and put used tissues straight in the bin. Avoid close contact with people who are showing possible symptoms. Follow NHS guidance on self-isolation and travel. How can you tell the difference between flu and Covid-19? The coronavirus outbreak hit amid flu season in the northern hemisphere and even doctors can struggle to distinguish between the two \\u2013 the overlap in symptoms probably contributed to slow detection of community infections in some countries, including Italy. Typical flu symptoms, which normally come on quickly, include a high fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, shivers, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, more occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea. Doctors are still working to understand the full scope of symptoms and severity for Covid-19, but early studies of patients taken to hospital found nearly all of them developed a fever and dry cough, and many had fatigue and muscle aches. Pneumonia (lung infection) is common in coronavirus patients, even outside the most severe cases, and this can lead to breathing difficulties. A runny nose and sore throat are far less common, reported by just 5% of patients. The only real confirmation of having Covid-19 is taking a test though. What should I do if I have symptoms? If you have symptoms or think you might have been exposed to the virus when travelling or through other contacts, call the NHS 111 service or visit the online service, or contact the equivalent service in your country. Do not go to a GP, pharmacy or hospital. If I get coronavirus, how sick will I get? A large study in China found that about 80% of confirmed cases had fairly mild symptoms (defined as no significant infection in the lungs). About 15% had severe symptoms that caused significant shortness of breath, low blood oxygen or other lung problems, and fewer than 5% of cases were critical, featuring respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ problems. However, it is possible that a larger number of very mild cases are going under the radar, and so this breakdown in severity could change over time as wider screening takes place. Older people and those with respiratory problems, heart disease or diabetes are at greater risk. What is the mortality rate of the new coronavirus? It is probably about or a bit less than 1%. Much higher figures have been flying about, but the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, is one of those who believes it will prove to be 1% or lower. The World Health Organization\\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, talked of 3.4%, but his figure was calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of officially confirmed cases. We know there are many more mild cases that do not get to hospital and are not being counted, which would bring the mortality rate significantly down. Deaths are highest in the elderly, with very low rates among younger people, although medical staff who treat patients and get exposed to a lot of virus are thought to be more at risk. But even among the over-80s, 90% will recover. Can you get infected on public transport? Most infections happen in families, where people live at close quarters. You need to be within one to two metres of somebody to be infected by viral-loaded water droplets from their coughs or when they are speaking. That is less likely on public transport. However, it would be possible to pick up the virus on your hands from a surface that somebody with the infection had touched. The virus can linger for 48 hours or even possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as the hand rail in the tube \\u2013 though less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes. Is there a cure for Covid-19? Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody at all. The most hopeful are Kaletra, which is a combination of two anti-HIV drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected. When will we get a vaccine? Efforts to develop an effective vaccine for Covid-19 have been quick compared with historical epidemics, such as Ebola. A number of teams are already testing vaccine candidates in animals and preparing to carry out small trials in people. The US company, Moderna Therapeutics, is already recruiting and hopes to enrol 45 volunteers between 18 and 55 and launch the trial by the end of April. Phase one trials like this look at whether the vaccine triggers an immune response and whether the given dose causes adverse effects and could be completed quite quickly. However, the subsequent phases, which will involve thousands of volunteers and will look more closely at efficacy, will take longer and obtaining a commercially available vaccine within a year would be extremely quick. The government\\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he did not think a working vaccine to protect people from the coronavirus would be produced in time for the current outbreak, but that a timeframe of a year or 18 months \\u201cwas not unreasonable to assume\\u201d.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 15, \"content_len\": 1185}, {\"title\": \"Biden Begging Donors To Stop Sending Money So He Can Quit Race\", \"url\": \"https://politics.theonion.com/biden-begging-donors-to-stop-sending-money-so-he-can-qu-1841815298\", \"content\": \"Imploring his supporters to relieve him of his obligations on the campaign trail, former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden reportedly begged his donors Thursday to stop sending him money so he could quit the presidential race. \\u201cLook, folks, we are at an important crossroads in our bid for the nomination, and I\\u2019m asking you from the bottom of my heart to please, please stop giving to my campaign so I can just end it already,\\u201d Biden wrote in an email sent to every individual, corporation, and political action committee that has contributed to his campaign, adding that with their generous help, they could help put him out of his misery at this \\u201ccrucial juncture\\u201d right before the Nevada caucus. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to be honest with you.

The launch was attended by Lulu Xingwana, minister for arts and culture at the time, who had been invited to officially open the show. But instead of giving a speech, Xingwana stormed out of the gallery after seeing images by the photographer Zanele Muholi that depicted naked women in close embrace. Muholi\\u2019s work, said the minister, was immoral, offensive and ran contrary to \\u201csocial cohesion and nation-building\\u201d. South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, with discrimination on the basis of sexuality barred by law. Yet censorious attitudes such as Xingwana\\u2019s towards homosexuality are widespread. Almost three-quarters of the population believe same-sex sexual activity is morally wrong, according to a 2016 survey. Similarly intolerant views are commonplace across Africa. Homosexuality is outlawed in 32 of the continent\\u2019s 54 nations. It is punishable by life imprisonment in Uganda, Tanzania and Sierra Leone. In Sudan, southern Somalia, Somaliland, Mauritania and northern Nigeria, the penalty is death. Against that backdrop the work of a photographer such as Muholi takes on a dual role, both representing individual artistic expression and operating as a form of political activism; a means to positively assert LGBTQ+ identity in straitened circumstances. Ama and Shana at lunch by Eric Gyamfi, 2016 Gay relationships are illegal in Ghana, where photographer Gyamfi was born, but the tender, intimate images in the series Just Like Us, where Gyamfi documents life in the country\\u2019s queer communities, do not dwell on the sexuality of his subjects but emphasise their ordinariness. As well as serving to resist oppression, Muholi\\u2019s imagery raises a larger question: how do you depict the reality of your life when your very existence is subject to denial or attack? The Ghanaian photographer Eric Gyamfi spent a year documenting queer individuals and communities in his series Just Like Us. Same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Ghana, but you wouldn\\u2019t know it from his pictures. Shot in gorgeously textured black and white, the photographs are an intimate evocation of everyday life, titled with studied plainness: Ama and Shana at lunch; Kwasi at Kokrobite beach; Atsu during dance; Kwasi in bed. When queerness is regarded as the opposite of normality, the answer, suggests Gyamfi, is to insist on the very ordinariness of the people being documented and in so doing declare them as individually complex as everyone else. \\u201cPeople are queer but people are also other things,\\u201d he says. \\u201cPeople who do not understand queerness have a singular notion of what queer people are supposed to be or supposed to look like. So what I came in to do was to show people that queer people are people first and that they cut across all categories of humanness. There is no singular way of showing who a queer person is, I feel. They can be anything or anybody.\\u201d Afrikan Boy Sittin\\u2019 by Hassan Hajjaj, 2013 With its explosion of colours and distinctive handmade frame, this image typifies the powerful and assertive nature of the Morocco-born photographer\\u2019s work. Hajjaj\\u2019s portraits confront prejudices about culture and identity head on. Gyamfi\\u2019s work both helps to normalise queerness, and throws into question the assumption that African societies are irredeemably homophobic. Notwithstanding the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ+ laws across the continent, his photographs illustrate the fact that queer lives do not exist outside the Ghanaian mainstream, but are an everyday aspect of society. This is also evident in the work of Sabelo Mlangeni. Narratives of queer community formation are mostly set in an urban context, where the anonymity and bustle of city life allows individuals to establish an identity and lifestyle on their own terms, unencumbered by ties of tradition or family. Mlangeni\\u2019s photographs tell a different tale. His Country Girls series focuses on gay men in remote, rural South African towns that are traditionally hostile to people who identify as LGBTQ+. Vintage by Sabelo Mlangeni, 2009 The South African photographer, who works mainly in black and white, documents queer life in the townships of Mpumalanga province in his Country Girls series. Homophobic violence is routine in the towns he visits, yet his work creates scenes of aspirational normality. We might, then, expect Country Girls to highlight a distinction between the conservative countryside and the cosmopolitan city, with Mlangeni\\u2019s subjects adrift in the former and yearning for the latter; in fact, his photographs depict rural communities of gay men living lives of friendship, play and love. The scholar Graeme Reid notes that in such settings, \\u201cgay people are regarded ambiguously\\u201d. Although perceived by some as \\u201cun-African\\u201d, they still maintain a place in rural society as the stylish, cosmopolitan outliers, \\u201cbringing the very latest fashion styles to the countryside. To be fashionable may be frivolous, modern and, by implication, untraditional, but gay people also embody a set of aspirations, a desire for the new.\\u201d Reid continues: \\u201cModernity is at once threatening and desirable, and to the extent that gay people occupy this symbolic space, they are both celebrated and despised.\\u201d Bhekezakhe, Parktown by Zanele Muholi, 2016 The self-portrait is part of a project entitled Somnyama Ngonyama (Hail, the Dark Lioness), in which the South African artist uses direct, psychologically charged images to confront the politics of race and representation. Other photographers of African origin woring today look outside specific issues of sexuality and explore cultural identity more broadly. Hassan Hajjaj\\u2019s photographs, which are shot in the streets and squares of Marrakech, show men and women desporting before the camera like fashion models, gleefully surmounting western cliches of Arab and north African comportment and identity. In work by Athi-Patra Ruga, identities swirl and change; the central figure in his dreamlike tableau Night of the Long Knives seems to exist beyond binaries of male and female, black and white, straight and queer. Likewise, in the work of Ruth Ossai, Jodi Bieber and Phumzile Khanyile, notions of masculinity, body image and the female form are challenged and re-examined. In the process, gender is revealed as complex, fluid and performative; a beginning, not an endpoint, in determining who we are. Kingsley Ossai, Nsukka, Enugu state, Nigeria by Ruth Ossai, 2017 Part of a series in which the British-Nigerian artist trains the lens on people from her local community, the image challenges ideas about gender, masculinity and what it means to be a man.

Flynn cut a deal as part of special counsel Robert Mueller\\u2019s investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. He initially cooperated with the investigation, which concluded last year without establishing criminal conspiracy but did lay out extensive evidence of contact between Trump aides and Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president himself. Flynn, who was fired as national security adviser after only 24 days in the role, has not yet been sentenced but a number of Trump aides and associates have been convicted and jailed in cases arising from Mueller\\u2019s work. Flynn faces possible prison time. He sought to withdraw his guilty plea in January, \\u201cbecause of the government\\u2019s bad faith, vindictiveness and breach of the plea agreement\\u201d. His change in tack came after he hired a new lawyer, Fox News pundit Sidney Powell, a longtime critic of the Mueller inquiry who has pedaled numerous false conspiracy theories on the investigation and other Trump policies and issues in prime time interviews. On Sunday, Trump tweeted: \\u201cSo now it is reported that, after destroying his life &amp; the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has \\u2018lost\\u2019 the records of General Michael Flynn.

Powell, who has also repeatedly retweeted antisemitic conspiracy theories, has contended in rambling legal filings that FBI officials altered an interview summary with Flynn and conspired to prevent him from obtaining legal counsel before he was interviewed. Trump\\u2019s use of the presidential pardon power has proved vastly controversial, as he has commuted sentences or pardoned prominent supporters including former sheriff Joe Arpaio and former New York City police commissioner Bernie Kerik. In cases related to the Russia investigation, Trump has flirted with the notion of pardoning or granting clemency to Paul Manafort, his former campaign chair who was found guilty of financial charges, and to Roger Stone, a longtime ally who was found guilty of lying to Congress and tampering with a witness. \\u201cSomebody has to stick up for the people,\\u201d Trump said in February.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 9, \"content_len\": 411}, {\"title\": \"UK ministers will no longer claim 'no successful examples' of Russian interference\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/15/uk-ministers-will-no-longer-claim-no-successful-examples-of-russian-interference\", \"content\": \"Ministers have been told they can no longer say there have been \\u201cno successful examples\\u201d of Russian disinformation affecting UK elections, after the apparent hacking of an NHS dossier seized on by Labour during the last campaign.

The scale of the Russian threat will be examined in the long-awaited report on Kremlin infiltration into British politics from the independent intelligence and security committee, which cannot be published until Downing Street appoints a new set of members following the election. Earlier this week, it emerged that among those in the frame were the error-prone former transport secretary Chris Grayling and recently sacked environment minister Theresa Villiers.

There are worried English people in Brussels and a French war person, Napoleon Bonaparte \\u2013 \\u201cBoney\\u201d, as people would period-specifically call him; you can check in books! \\u2013 is making them worry Englishly. But the Lady Duke of Richmond is holding a ball, to show that she has a period-specific ballroom and won\\u2019t be intimidated by French war people, no she will not! Philip Glenister is James Trenchard, a trenchant trencherman and victualler \\u2013 which is pronounced \\u2018vittler\\u2019 \\u2013 to the English soldiers who are stationed in Brussels in case Boney tries any of his French warring. To the chagrin (\\u201cshame and embarrassment\\u201d across La Manche) of his slightly better-born wife, Anne (Tamsin Greig), James has wangled invitations to the lady duke\\u2019s ball, despite being born to a family of tubers in Covent Garden before he became a successful merchant potato in Frenchland. He is also ignorant-potatoely encouraging his daughter Sophia in her flirtation with the duchess\\u2019s nephew, Edmund, Lord Bellasis (Jeremy Neumark Jones), even though she is, of course, half-potato and he cannot marry for love, no matter how much he wants a plate of chips. All clear so far? Frenchies! Englisheses! Balls! Great! The ball begins, even though Anne \\u201cMaris Piper\\u201d Trenchard has said: \\u201cHow strange that we should be having a ball when we are on the brink of war!\\u201d Anyone who is anyone is there, especially if they are the Duke of Wellington or the Prince of Orange (\\u201cTop Dutchman! Feel m\\u2019clogs!\\u201d). The Lady Duke of Richmond is enchanting, Anne is mortified and everyone manages to keep a straight face during the sword-dancing display. All is going swimmingly, although Sophia professes to Edmund that she is a bit worried about the Wikipedia entry she read before about Boney\\u2019s advance before getting into her unbecoming but period-specific ballgown, and the possibility of this becoming the most famous ball in history, when Wellington is notified by a messenger that Boney \\u2013 Napoleon Bonaparte \\u2013 has unexpectedly arrived at the nearby strategic crossroads of Quatre Bras, which is French for Four Somethings. But Edmund tells her: \\u201cDon\\u2019t be silly, my little Jersey Royal! Nothing can happen to us! We\\u2019re the luckiest couple alive!\\u201d Sophia is relieved. \\u201cAnd the most in love!\\u201d she replies. No, she really does. Alas, alack, a message is delivered to Wellington. It does say that the Bonester is at the strategic crossroads of Quatre Bras. Sacr\\u00e9 bleu \\u2013 or, more patriotically, crumbs! Everyone who has a penis, is wearing a red jacket, and is not one of the sword dancers gathers in the Man Duke of Richmond\\u2019s study to pore over a parchment map and note that, if they don\\u2019t stop French war man at Four Somethings, they may have to do battle nearby at \\u2026 Where-a-loo? What-a-loo? Waterloo! Crikey. I hope we win. Off they go \\u2013 Wellers, Orangey and, sad to say, young Eddie. Sophia is distraught. Also, they need a victualler, pronounced vittler, so James heads off, too. He comes back from his first battlefield a broken man \\u2013 and no wonder. \\u201cA very awful sight it was, too,\\u201d he tells Anne while staring into the middle distance, possibly at his agent, whom I imagine is standing with everyone else\\u2019s in the wings urging them to think of Maggie Smith\\u2019s pension and stagger on. \\u201cBodies everywhere,\\u201d he says. \\u201cGroans from the wounded. Scavengers\\u201d \\u2013 you can practically see the beads of sweat that must have formed on Fellowes\\u2019 brow as he dug deep to recreate the hellish scene for viewers \\u2013 \\u201cpicking at the corpses!\\u201d Not only that, but Edmund was killed, quite dead, fatally too. James breaks the news to his baby new potato that her bit of fancy steak has had his frites. She is distraught again. SMASH CUT to 26 years later. Afternoon tea has been invented, Sophia is dead, the titular London district of Belgravia has been built (by James, in partnership with Thomas Cubitt, dontcha know) and the script is even worse. Once we are ensconced with the Trenchards in their townhouse, we are introduced to the servants and all pretence that this is not Downton Abbey \\u2013 in, uh, Belgravia \\u2013 collapses. On the upside, Harriet Walter has arrived as Lady Brockenhurst and Alice Eve is an early Victorian meany of the first water.

She stands against a backdrop of blazing red sky and says: \\u201cI saw the final flame. The flame of the end of the world.\\u201d If Robert Lepage\\u2019s seven-hour play begins with doomy premonitions of end times, it takes us to unexpected places in its portrait of human resilience in the face of large-scale historical trauma, which begins with the dropping of the atomic bomb. If Hiroshima is \\u201ca city of death and destruction, it is also a city of rebirth and survival\\u201d, we are told, and it feels like a message of hope for our own anxious times. Directed by Lepage and staged by Ex Machina, the drama was originally produced in 1994 (that version was a mere three hours). This iteration opened in 1996 and is back on the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima. Seven interconnecting stories take us around the world (New York, Osaka, Amsterdam, Nazi-occupied Terez\\u00edn) and across half a century. Trauma unites the strands: the generational fallout of Hiroshima, Aids, the Holocaust. The original source for the diverging plotlines is a Madame Butterfly-style love affair between an American army photographer documenting the damage in Hiroshima and a Japanese woman whose face we never see but are told has been disfigured by war. The scale of the imagination and ideas in this production is panoramic and engineered to dazzle, it seems. Its staging combines traditional Japanese music and dance with farce, mime, opera, silent film tropes, clowning and video installation. It ought to feel like a surfeit of forms, but because of its pacing \\u2013 slow or silent scenes last minutes at a time \\u2013 it is elegant rather than excessive. It is all the more an achievement in that it manages to contain a sense of the vast and epic while also building a surprising level of intimacy and emotional depth. An assisted suicide comes in the middle of the play; Jeffrey (Christian Essiambre) is a central character who has Aids and his deathbed scene is unrushed and unbearably tragic. The drama at Theresienstadt concentration camp is staged as if it is taking place inside an infinity of mirrors, and its mother-daughter storyline has the look and feel of a macabre fairytale. Carl Fillon and Ariane Sauv\\u00e9\\u2019s stage designs blaze with imagination, too. The sets are protean and change within a heartbeat, sometimes with humour: an Amsterdam red-light district collapses into a sterile war library; an opaque house full of sliding doors in Hiroshima becomes a New York tenement block featuring bohemians in their underpants, and back-screens are torn apart to reveal different times and places. It is a shock when the cast of 13 (including three children) emerges for its final bow because the production creates the illusion of theatre on a grand scale. Essiambre and Rebecca Blankenship are especially strong performers (the latter has a sensational operatic voice, too), but as an ensemble they are all striking in their parts, and even peripheral characters are well realised. It is not without flaws, though; some plotlines feel less tethered, especially a section about a pregnant actress, which is the longest scene in the play. The last hour becomes slightly mannered and overly symbolic, and not all its strands come together, so that it feels \\u2013 maybe intentionally \\u2013 like an intricate jigsaw puzzle with parts missing. Yet it performs a seduction so complete that these flaws do not mar the pleasure of the production. Lepage has spoken of the play as a marathon for its audience, but no part feels gruelling. It is ravishing \\u201cevent theatre\\u201d that pushes at the boundaries of theatrical possibility and it should not be missed.

Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC\\u2019s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin \\u201cpractising\\u201d to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly. Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required. Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight\\u2019s worth of food. Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing. On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled. Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports \\u201cor things of that nature\\u201d. On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government\\u2019s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a \\u201csix-month window\\u201d although it \\u201cmight be longer\\u201d. Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others. \\u201cIt \\u2013 it is potential that could be the case,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.\\u201d Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: \\u201cPotentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.\\u201d \\u201cThere are no options that are off the table,\\u201d Hunt said. \\u201cThe paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.\\u201d Murphy said authorities were \\u201cstrongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call \\u2018social distancing\\u2019. \\u201cSo that\\u2019s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact \\u2026 not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.\\u201d Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more \\u201cmay well change\\u201d but Australia, which he said had \\u201conly 250 cases\\u201d, was still \\u201cahead of the curve\\u201d. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should \\u2026 [exercise] more social distancing,\\u201d he said, and \\u201cavoid things that aren\\u2019t essential\\u201d. Murphy said for others the risk of attending public places with fewer than 500 people, such as a cinema, was still at this stage \\u201crelatively low\\u201d and at the moment authorities were not recommending people stop taking the train. As case numbers increase, the medical advice will respond to recommend greater social distancing, he said. \\u201cI think the gym is fine but everybody at the moment needs to practise very good hygiene. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to the gym, I would be very focused on hand washing, using hand sanitisers, all of those social distancing, good hygiene measures, we want everybody in the community to start practising those.\\u201d Asked about the Victorian chief medical officer\\u2019s suggestion people should stockpile a fortnight\\u2019s worth of food, Murphy replied it was \\u201ca little bit premature at the moment\\u201d. \\u201cFor most people we don\\u2019t want to encourage major panic buying at the moment \\u2013 we\\u2019ve seen that with the supermarket chains. But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.\\u201d Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice. He said governments did not want to \\u201cmove too early\\u201d because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and \\u201ctaking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains\\u201d. Murphy said there was \\u201cno question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they\\u2019ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time\\u201d. \\u201cSo you don\\u2019t want to move too early.\\u201d Murphy said there were \\u201cvery few reports of symptomatic infection in children\\u201d and authorities don\\u2019t know \\u201cwhether children are getting infected but just don\\u2019t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they\\u2019re not getting infected\\u201d. \\u201cThe former is probably more likely.\\u201d Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity. Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they\\u2019re feeling unwell. Murphy said Australian authorities define \\u201cclose contact\\u201d \\u2013 which requires self-isolation \\u2013 as \\u201csomeone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before\\u201d. He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are \\u201cvery, very unlikely to have been infectious\\u201d. On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was \\u201caghast\\u201d at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response. Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy\\u2019s advice on hand shaking was \\u201cinconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying\\u201d and argued there is \\u201cno coherent advice\\u201d about whether schools should open from Monday. Bowtell said the government appeared to \\u201chave no plan\\u201d for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was \\u201cimperative\\u201d to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals. Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday. Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an \\u201cabundance of caution\\u201d and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined. Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined \\u201cthe relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March\\u201d, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday\\u2019s meeting. On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a \\u201cnational cabinet\\u201d made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday. So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn.

And in this one, those of us who cling on to collectivist, egalitarian ideas can discern things that speak to our sense of how the world ought to be organised. To find crumbs of political comfort in a dire public health emergency might seem inappropriate. But unforeseen events always have consequences beyond their immediate impact: just because they fit some of our existing beliefs that does not make them any less real. Even if the new imperative of \\u201csocial distancing\\u201d sounds like the ultimate example of individualism and frantic panic-buying does not exactly look like an expression of altruism, our shared humanity has also been brought to the surface, or soon will be. As the rapid appearance online of community help initiatives proves, we are already getting used to doing some of what the common good requires. And as usually happens with sudden adverse events, the arrival of the Covid-19 virus has pushed the state and public sector into the foreground. The government machine suddenly looks less like the sclerotic inconvenience that annoys people like Dominic Cummings than the most basic means of help we have. Only weeks ago, people close to Boris Johnson were declaring war on the civil service and the BBC; now, both institutions are surely at the heart of however we collectively proceed. Ministers are suddenly back on the Radio 4 Today programme. Mindful that people have actually not had enough of experts, Johnson is now at pains to be seen deferring to the chief medical officer and the government\\u2019s chief scientific adviser. If the big-spending budget suggested that Cummings and his allies\\u2019 quest to pull Conservatism somewhere different was in full roar, the arrival of Covid-19 surely means their revolutionary plans for the state have been postponed. Something comparable may be afoot in the US. Last week, the New York Times ran a piece of political analysis headlined \\u201cTrump meets an enemy that can\\u2019t be tweeted away\\u201d. Covid-19, said the writer, \\u201cdoes not respond to Mr Trump\\u2019s favourite instruments of power: it cannot be cowed by Twitter posts, it cannot be shot down by drones, it cannot be overcome by party solidarity, it cannot be overpowered by campaign rally chants.\\u201d Reality, it seemed, had suddenly intruded on a presidency built on performance and manipulation, and Trump had instantly been found wanting. Again, whatever one\\u2019s politics, there is an undeniable truth to all this. As we know, the US is way behind other countries on testing, and cuts made by the Trump administration to crucial branches of government now look supremely reckless. The kind of denial the president was still pushing only a week or so ago forms part of the same picture: with accidental echoes of the occasion in 2006 when Johnson paid humorous tribute to laissez-faire government by praising the fictional mayor from Jaws and his decision to keep his beaches open, Trump has recently been lampooned as the real thing, downplaying a mounting emergency, lest it threaten the economic success on which his re-election might depend. Woven through this take on the president\\u2019s position is a progressive article of faith: the idea that although populists might be capable rabble-rousers, they always fall down when it comes to basic competence. This, clearly, is the Democratic party\\u2019s collective rationale for the anointing of Joe Biden, the walking embodiment of the idea that the best alternative to Trump\\u2019s misrule is the reassuringly dull, conventional statesmanship of yesteryear. Might such a sea-change be a realistic prospect? For a long time now, all over the world, politics and government and their surrounding discourse have increasingly amounted to a spectacle of anger, rhetoric and a supposed battle of values in which the political right \\u2013 particularly its latter-day, populist incarnation \\u2013 has usually been on the winning side. The story perhaps began with George W Bush\\u2019s consigliere Karl Rove, and his characterisation of his boss\\u2019s detractors as \\u201cthe reality-based community\\u201d: its subsequent milestones include both the arrival in office of a president whose metier is outrage and provocation rather than anything material, and Brexit\\u2019s triumph of prejudice and romance over facts and figures. As reality bites, something about coronavirus feels like it might at least have loosened the grip of these ideas. Whatever his outbursts, every day brings unflattering footage of Trump among scientists, officials and the representatives of big US companies and the image of an awkward, impatient man, arms folded, seemingly determined to shut out whatever wisdom might be on offer. Here, the BBC\\u2019s Newsnight recently saw fit to broadcast a characteristically nuanced view of the government\\u2019s response to the virus from Nigel Farage, to a loud chorus of groans. His inclusion seemed not just incongruous, but silly. And therein lay a tantalising prospect: of a political discourse that might sooner or later reconnect to the basics of government, and the real world. And yet, and yet. Europe is still haunted by populist ghouls, predictably claiming that the virus validates everything they stand for: Matteo Salvini, Marine Le Pen and Hungary\\u2019s Viktor Orb\\u00e1n, whose national security adviser recently claimed to see \\u201ca certain link between coronavirus and illegal migrants\\u201d. Ten days ago, I was on a reporting job in Worksop, the former Nottinghamshire mining town in a local government district whose vote-share for Brexit was nearly 70%. The huge TV in the breakfast room was blaring out some or other piece about Covid-19, which soon caught the attention of the staff member in charge. \\u201cI think this is all bollocks,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to tell me it was a coincidence it started in an overpopulated country.\\u201d Two fiftysomething men had just ordered their food, and instantly joined in. \\u201cThe first thing they can do is stop all these refugees coming in,\\u201d said one. Their apparent default setting was stubborn disbelief, mixed with the conviction that this latest emergency would not have arrived had it not been for foreigners. As if clumsily leading his kindred spirits across the world to the correct position, Trump has moved through these two phases in a matter of days. Only a week or so ago, he favoured denial. Now, as evidenced by the televised address he delivered last Wednesday and his ban on flights from Europe, his embrace of drastic measures is framed by the kind of themes that won him the presidency. His spiel contained the giveaway words \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d; inside 40 seconds, he used the phrase \\u201cforeign virus\\u201d. By way of mood music, senior Republicans talk about the pandemic as the \\u201cChinese coronavirus\\u201d or \\u201cWuhan coronavirus\\u201d, and everything blurs into the ocean of conspiracy theory now swirling around online, which Trump is inevitably happy to stoke. Whatever the controversies over its approach to the virus, and the prime minister\\u2019s long record of playing to base prejudice, our own government has chosen a higher path. But hateful, ugly things are out there in the culture, and may yet rise to the surface. In stories of public service in the most awful circumstances and a rising sense that the only useful responses to this crisis are necessarily empathetic and humane, you see people \\u2013 and governments \\u2013 at their best. But whatever the impacts of the most serious health emergency in a generation, perhaps a model of politics based on division and polarisation is now so embedded that it will inevitably condition some of the world\\u2019s response. History suggests as much: steps forward always accompanied by lurches back, as humanity does what it usually does, and simply muddles through. \\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 1269}, {\"title\": \"Afterlife?

As of Friday, there were more than 1,600 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus across the US, with 41 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. However, the actual number of infected Americans is certain to be far higher, with the true toll obscured by a calamitous lack of testing. A lack of planning and restrictions that barred testing people without symptoms, even though the virus can be asymptomatic for some time, or those not arriving from overseas virus hotspots has needlessly worsened the situation, critics said. In the period from last Sunday until Wednesday morning, the CDC tested just 77 people in the US. By stark comparison the Utah Jazz basketball team alone managed to test 58 people as the NBA, along with scores of schools, Broadway shows and various other cultural and sporting events were shut down. Even in Washington state, where 31 people have died, health officials have had to ration test kits. On 31 January the Trump administration restricted travel from China, where Covid-19 originated, but then efforts to ramp up testing and ensure containment stalled. In a key setback, the administration rejected World Health Organization testing kits in favor of developing its own, which turned out to be faulty. \\u201cThe response has been frustrating and disappointing,\\u201d said Thomas Chen-chia Tsai, a surgeon in Boston and faculty member of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \\u201cThe strict quarantine measures in China bought the rest of the world a few weeks of time but in the US we were on the sidelines rather than reacting. It was a missed opportunity. If there was a targeted response we\\u2019d be in a very different position now. \\u201cThe US government didn\\u2019t want to cause panic but Americans panic when there they sense there\\u2019s no plan. That vacuum creates panic.\\u201d This muddled response was exacerbated by Donald Trump who, reportedly fearful of the impact upon the stock market and his own re-election prospects, initially dismissed fears over the coronavirus as a \\u201choax\\u201d before stating that infections were \\u201cgoing very substantially down, not up\\u201d. The administration promised millions of testing kits would be easily available to Americans. All of these pronouncements have proved untrue, leading to sharp criticism of Trump. In an unusually stinging editorial, Holden Thorp, a chemist and editor-in-chief of Science, said the president\\u2019s \\u201cdistortion and denial is dangerous and almost certainly contributed to the federal government\\u2019s sluggish response. After three years of debating whether the words of this administration matter, the words are now clearly a matter of life and death.\\u201d The worsening situation has been acknowledged even by allies of the president. \\u201cWe probably lost the chance to have an outcome like South Korea,\\u201d said Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration chief under Trump, referencing a country that has helped curb the outbreak by testing nearly 20,000 people every day. \\u201cWe must do everything to avert the tragic suffering being borne by Italy.\\u201d Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, admitted in testimony to Congress this week that authorities had failed to respond swiftly to the spread of coronavirus. \\u201cThe idea of anybody getting [testing] easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we are not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes. But we are not,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is a failing. I mean, let\\u2019s admit it.\\u201d The US is now bracing itself for a huge wave of new infections without a coherent federal government response. Hampered structurally by the country\\u2019s lack of paid sick leave and a for-profit healthcare system that makes going to the doctor prohibitively expensive for millions of Americans, states and cities are falling back on \\u201csocial distancing\\u201d measures such as shutting down large gatherings and promoting good hygiene. Belated actions by Trump, such as banning travel from much of Europe, have done little to tackle a virus that has already raced across the American continent, with experts now predicting that tens of millions of people will become infected. Andy Slavitt, former head of Medicare under Barack Obama\\u2019s administration, tweeted that there were expectations of \\u201cover 1 million deaths in the US since the virus was not contained &amp; we cannot even test for it. This will be recorded as a major preventable public health disaster.\\u201d Even a sudden surge in testing, combined with accurate, sober advice from the Trump administration, won\\u2019t prevent a huge strain placed upon a fragmented American healthcare system that delivers wildly different outcomes for people depending upon their financial means. Ominously, there are far fewer hospital beds per capita in the US compared to the Lombardy region in Italy, where the coronavirus has overwhelmed the healthcare system. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have all the beds we need and if this thing hits us full on we are going to be up the creek,\\u201d said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. \\u201cWe started with a very crippled public health system that has been underfunded for many years and we knew that something like this would cause us huge challenges.

And when the world eventually emerges from this pandemic, it is likely to be irrevocably altered. In the words of one public health expert, Professor Graham Medley: \\u201cThis is the kind of event that is going to live on for decades.\\u201d It will either cause illness or death on a scale most of us have not experienced in our lifetimes, or it will take huge changes to the way we live our lives in order to avoid that. The social impact will be more momentous than anything Britain has experienced since the two world wars. This weekend, ministers have warned that increasingly stringent measures will be introduced on people\\u2019s movements in the coming days and weeks, and that they are likely to be in place for months. More of us will be asked to self-isolate or to reduce the contact we have with other people for long periods of time. Many will be asked to work from home for weeks, if not months. Travelling abroad will become increasingly restricted. Major sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled, with others likely to follow. In an unprecedented move, local and mayoral elections have been delayed by a year. But by far the most devastating likely impact of this pandemic was hinted at by the prime minister last Thursday. \\u201cMany more families are going to lose loved ones,\\u201d he said at a press conference. This is the frightening truth about what the government\\u2019s top scientists believe is to come. Policy under scrutiny Amid rising public anxiety, there is more scrutiny than ever of the government\\u2019s decision to move from the \\u201ccontain\\u201d to the \\u201cdelay\\u201d phase of its strategy. The emphasis has shifted from tracing and testing all those who have been in contact with people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, to asking all those with symptoms to self-isolate. The government also announced some further limited measures to limit social contact: from next week, mass events with more than 500 people will be banned. But it has faced strong criticism from some public health experts for not taking more stringent action, such as larger-scale closures of places where people congregate, restrictions on public transport, closure of schools and asking more people to self-isolate. The government says it will phase in more stringent restrictions in the coming days and weeks, and that it is not looking at this point to suppress the spread of the virus altogether. There appear to be two interrelated reasons for this. The first is that the government\\u2019s experts are concerned that asking people to observe strict social distancing measures for long periods of time, such as widespread self-isolation even for those with no symptoms, could backfire. Like all governments, it is trying to minimise the extent to which demand for critical care exceeds maximum capacity in the NHS, in order to keep death rates from the virus as low as possible and to give the NHS time to do what it can to extend that capacity, already low by European standards. There is clearly a worry that it is untenable to ask people to fundamentally alter their lifestyles for very long stretches of time and that to introduce some measures now would be to risk a significant peak in cases further down the line if people were to abandon those lifestyle changes later on, for example, because they no longer believed they were needed, or could not afford to do so. Second, the government\\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said that its strategy is driven by the objective of developing herd immunity, which occurs when a sufficient number of people in a population are immune to a disease, to offer some level of protection to everyone. He has said that the government\\u2019s working assumption is that about 60% of the population will need to catch the disease in order to achieve that. This implies the government is assuming that, even with social distancing measures in place, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the population will contract coronavirus before a treatment or vaccine becomes available, and the best it can do is to manage the flow of people requiring hospitalisation in order to protect those who are most vulnerable. This sits in stark contrast to the strategy deployed by a country such as South Korea \\u2013 whose lead most other countries are following \\u2013 which is to delay the rate at which the virus spreads as much as possible, using much more stringent social distancing measures and a more comprehensive testing and isolation regime. Public confidence This difference has prompted serious questions about why the government\\u2019s strategy differs from much of the rest of the world. Would 60% of the population contracting the virus be enough to offer any meaningful level of population immunity? Is it even right to assume that people contracting the virus will develop long-term immunity? On what sort of evidence is the government basing its assumption that the public will only tolerate stringent social distancing for so long? Why does it appear that there have been few measures and little guidance to protect those most vulnerable to the symptoms of Covid-19 \\u2013 older people and those with underlying medical conditions \\u2013 as the disease spreads? On the other hand, there are huge uncertainties and risks involved in trying to halt the spread of the disease as much as possible at this time. What would happen if people broke quarantine before a treatment or vaccine was developed? What might be the impact on the NHS of a large peak in cases as we move into next winter? What would be the impact of immediately closing schools, given that grandparents are likely to pick up the childcare slack and children are more likely to mix outside school the longer closures go on? This would significantly affect the availability of those doing critical jobs in the NHS, care homes and the food supply chain. This is why anyone who expresses with absolute certainty that the government has got this entirely wrong should be treated with some scepticism. There is no surefire way to combat the virus: there are too many unknowns for that. It is however, absolutely right that public health experts are asking questions about why this strategy is so divergent from the overall recommendations of the World Health Organization. The government must be far more transparent about the evidence and assumptions on which it is basing its decisions, or risk undermining public confidence in its actions. There are other problems beyond a lack of transparency. Ministers have said they will seek to legislate for sweeping emergency powers that will last for two years, including giving the police the power to detain suspected victims of the virus, and reducing standards in care homes to allow for staff shortages. Such powers should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and should initially be introduced on a more temporary basis to avoid significant incursions on our liberty and a watering down of basic standards becoming the new norm. Moreover, after a decade of austerity that has put services like the NHS and social care under intolerable strain, and eroded tax credits for families, there are questions to be asked about whether last week\\u2019s budget went far enough in terms of channelling additional resources to public services and protecting low-income families from the forthcoming massive economic shock. International cooperation The contrast between the approach taken by the UK and the rest of the world has also prompted questions about the lack of coordination at an international level, both in relation to the public health or the economic response. \\u201cOur willingness to cooperate is becoming inversely related to our need to do so,\\u201d Gordon Brown wrote last week. He is right: this pandemic is exposing the extent to which the international organisations and networks that exist to promote global cooperation are fraying as a result of the spread of populism. At a moment when the US might once have provided global leadership, President Trump is flailing; having spent weeks denying the existence of a looming pandemic, he has now politicised the crisis, erratically introducing measures that seem designed to bolster his America First re-election campaign rather than protect citizens. Coronavirus may be the most pressing and immediate global challenge we face; but there are plenty more to come, from microbial resistance to the climate crisis. Effective solutions will only be found if countries rediscover a willingness to work in concert. International cooperation may be proving elusive, but we should take hope from one comfort that might emerge from this crisis: it is heartening to see so many individuals pitching in to help neighbours, or offering to support older people who may be isolated and lonely. This pandemic may leave us a legacy of social action and civic engagement that we should seek to sustain long after its worst threat has subsided. Life may be about to change immeasurably in a way most of us would not have dreamed of just weeks ago. But by looking out for each other, by following government advice even as we question it with healthy scepticism, and by acting for the greater good, we can collectively try to minimise the pain that will undoubtedly be wrought by this pandemic.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 1551}, {\"title\": \"Lord Puttnam warns of skills shortage in UK film\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/15/lord-puttnam-warns-of-skills-shortage-in-uk-film\", \"content\": \"The Oscar-winning producer David Puttnam has warned Britain will be eclipsed as a movie powerhouse unless there is an urgent push to tackle a skills shortage and to recruit new talent.

But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said widespread school closures would not take place, despite a raft of other new measures to contain the spread of the virus. Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great. \\u201cPeople are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,\\u201d Morrison told reporters in Sydney. \\u201cAs the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate. \\u201cWhen you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.\\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources. Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown. Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said. Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the \\u201copportune public health decision\\u201d with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later. \\u201cGiven that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,\\u201d one source said.

Legal &amp; General Investment Management (LGIM), which has been one of the most outspoken fund managers over the climate crisis, made the decision after a number of clients raised concerns that stocks such as Shell were still being included in its range of ethical funds. Those clients include PensionBee \\u2013 an online pension provider that handles \\u00a3750m-worth of client assets for more than 75,000 customers \\u2013 which is expected to be among the new fund\\u2019s first investors. It wrote to LGIM last year after being inundated with questions from its own customers about the fact that Shell was among the top 10 holdings in one of the investment firm\\u2019s ethically focused Future World funds. PensionBee is believed to be one of the fund\\u2019s top five owners, with more than \\u00a360m invested. \\u201cIt is clear that there is increasingly strong demand for pension products that give customers the choice to divest from oil,\\u201d PensionBee said. While the full stock list for the new fossil fuel-free fund has not yet been confirmed, it will exclude oil companies and take a wider ethical stance by barring investments in tobacco, weapons makers and pure coal manufacturers. Emma Douglas, the head of defined contribution at LGIM, said: \\u201cBased on our funds in our Future World range, the new fund will be driven by long-term thematic analysis, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations and active ownership, which means engaging to bring about real, positive change in the companies we invest in.\\u201d LGIM, which has more than \\u00a31tn in assets, said the fund will be open to corporate pension schemes and individuals. The investment firm has defended holding Shell in its Future World range of funds. Those funds are governed by its climate impact pledge, meaning it is willing to exclude companies over poor governance and weak climate disclosures, as well as for lobbying politicians on policies that risk accelerating the climate crisis. LGIM has said it needs to balance environmental and financial concerns when putting together the investment portfolio, previously noting that Shell is one of the largest payers of dividends in the UK. Its climate pledge has led LGIM to dump stakes in China Construction Bank, Rosneft Oil, Japan Post Holdings, Subaru, Loblaw and Sysco Corporation in 2018. Last year, it cut a further five stocks from the ethical funds, including the oil corporation ExxonMobil, the insurer MetLife, the maker of Spam, Hormel Foods, the US retailer Kroger and Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) last year. However, a Guardian analysis last year also found LGIM as a whole had spent about $367m (\\u00a3285m) between January and November, increasing its stake in those companies in other parts of the business, even when accounting for the divestments. LGIM openly admits it continues to hold stakes in companies excluded from those environmentally and socially focused funds, saying it gives them the opportunity to engage with the board and ultimately influence company behaviour. Commenting on the launch of the fossil fuel-free fund, PensionBee said: \\u201cWe hope this is just the start of all savers using their investments to transform the world they live in \\u2013 for the better of the planet, society and their retirement.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 553}, {\"title\": \"Football behind closed doors may tell us much about how home advantage works | Tim Lewis\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/15/valencia-atalanta-football-behind-closed-doors-home-advantage\", \"content\": \"The Mestalla in Valencia has to be one of the most intimidating stadiums in the world for visiting football teams. Its stands, which have the pitch of a ski jump, allow home fans to create a claustrophobic wall of noise. The rabid screams of 55,000 Valencians, bouncing off the concrete foundations, have made it something of a fortress for the local team and a popular venue for Spain\\u2019s home fixtures. A while back, I watched Valencia play Barcelona at the Mestalla, and there was a febrile menace in the air that night unlike any other I have experienced in a football ground. The vibe at the Mestalla was rather different last week, when Valencia hosted Atalanta in the second leg of the sides\\u2019 Champions League last-16 tie. If ever a team needed a boost from their 12th man, their fans, it was now: Valencia had to make up a 4-1 deficit from the first leg. But, because of the coronavirus outbreak, the fixture was played behind closed doors. Watching the match on TV was eerie: you could hear the players shouting for the ball or celebrating or appealing for a foul. At times you had to remind yourself that it wasn\\u2019t a training exercise. The match became even more listless after just 90 seconds, when Atalanta were awarded a penalty. The Slovenian striker Josip Ilicic buried it and added three more in a 4-3 victory. \\u201cFabulous game missed by fans at Mestalla,\\u201d Gary Lineker tweeted. \\u201cImagine scoring all 4 goals like Ilicic has done with barely a soul in the stadium.\\u201d On Friday, it was announced that all elite football in England and Scotland will be postponed until at least April. The Champions League and Europa League have also been suspended. What happens next is decidedly murky. There may be play\\u2011offs to decide titles and relegation. Euro 2020 could be delayed. And there might well be more surreal spectacles like the one that played out between Valencia and Atalanta. If more matches do have to be played in empty stadiums without fans, can we expect it to affect the results? Will Liverpool suddenly be less formidable without the Kop behind them? Home advantage is one of the immutable facts of sport, especially football \\u2013 what happens when you remove the crowd from the equation? Playing sport behind closed doors has traditionally been used as a punishment for the home team. In football, it dates back to the early 1980s, when English clubs were feared across Europe for their tenacity on the field and their brutality off it. West Ham were the first team on the receiving end. In September 1980, the Hammers played Castilla, essentially Real Madrid\\u2019s feeder team, at the Bernab\\u00e9u in the European Cup Winners Cup. When they lost 3-1 in the first leg \\u2013 perhaps because they were humiliated by losing to a second\\u2011string outfit, or maybe because they just fancied a punch-up \\u2013 the West Ham supporters went on the rampage. Dozens were ejected from the stadium; outside, one was run over by a bus and died. Uefa determined that the second leg should be played in an empty Upton Park. In fact, the official attendance was 262, when you took players, staff, ball kids and media into account. But the atmosphere was unquestionably odd: the West Ham goalkeeper Phil Parkes recalled afterwards that he had to tune out commentary on the game from a radio behind the goal. It became known as \\u201cthe ghost match\\u201d. In one sense, West Ham were punished for the riot in Madrid: the club would have expected a full house of 36,000 for the second leg, so it made a hefty dent in their income. But what about on the pitch? Did West Ham suffer from not having the Upton Park faithful roaring them on? Not especially. Back in London, West Ham tied the match 3-1 in 90 minutes; in extra time they scored two more. It was a similar story in September 1982, when Aston Villa were made to start their European campaign on a Wednesday afternoon at 2.30pm in front of 187 spectators, as a censure for rioting by their supporters the previous season in Belgium. Again, it wasn\\u2019t much of a punishment: Villa beat Besiktas 3-1. Internazionale had to play three Champions League home games behind closed doors in 2005, and they won all three. So we\\u2019re clear: it\\u2019s not that home clubs usually perform better when forced to play behind closed doors. That\\u2019s probably not the case, and there\\u2019s not enough statistical evidence to confirm or deny it. But these matches played without supporters do make you wonder how influential fans in the stadium are to the performance of their beloved team. Research shows home advantage is clearly and definitely a major factor in football. Taken aAcross all teams and all leagues in England, the home team invariably wins around 45% of matches, and draws 25%. Fans might believe this is down to their support but actually the size of the crowd and the intensity of their screaming does not appear to have a significant impact on the result. Where the home crowd can sometimes have a game-changing influence, however, is on the decisions of the referee. A couple of studies have indicated that football officials \\u2013 unwittingly, of course \\u2013 were wary of making controversial calls against the home team because they suspected, perhaps subliminally, that the crowd would turn on them. In practice, this means fewer yellow cards, more penalties given \\u2013 and the louder and more partisan the crowd, the greater the unconscious bias. If some of the key fixtures this season do end up being decided behind closed doors, they will be intriguing to watch (obviously on a screen, not in the stands). Will referees make better decisions? Will the intensity of home players dip without the crowd to gee them up? Or, counter-intuitively, will these players suddenly display a new sense of freedom? Joey Barton once complained that abusive Newcastle fans at St James\\u2019 Park had destroyed the confidence of the players. Likewise, there must have been times when Gary Neville was manager at Valencia in 2016 when he wished the Mestalla was empty. As thrilling as it must be when 55,000 fans are chanting your name, imagine how soul-destroying it is when they are screaming as one: \\u201cGary, vete ya!\\u201d or \\u201cGary, go now!\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 16, \"content_len\": 1064}, {\"title\": \"Write a diary, take action: Hubei residents on fighting coronavirus anxiety\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/write-a-diary-take-action-hubei-residents-on-fighting-coronavirus-anxiety\", \"content\": \"In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress. As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health. Guo Jing, 29, Wuhan: \\u2018Make yourself a point of connection\\u2019 At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn\\u2019t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent. Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better. Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support. There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day. It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can\\u2019t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live. By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups. It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself. Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don\\u2019t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious. Werther Huang, 22, Wuhan: \\u2018Ask for help\\u2019 It\\u2019s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven\\u2019t been able to concentrate on my work. I don\\u2019t absorb what I\\u2019m reading. I\\u2019m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can\\u2019t help it. I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing. If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help. Take advantage of this time to care for yourself and your family. Shen Miao, 30, Tianmen city, Hubei province: \\u2018I write every day\\u2019 I came home from Wuhan the day before the lockdown. Like most people, I didn\\u2019t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family. I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted. Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn\\u2019t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people\\u2019s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much. I feel like I am a survivor. It\\u2019s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a \\u201clock down\\u201d diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions. Seeing other people reply has let me know that I am not alone. Everyone is in this situation. I am not special. Hu, 22 Huanggang city, Hubei: \\u2018Talking with friends is really important\\u2019 I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure. Talking with friends is also really important. On the night of 6 February [when the Chinese doctor and whistleblower Li Wenliang died], I spent all night reading the news on Weibo and WeChat. Like me, my friends didn\\u2019t sleep. Every update someone saw, they would immediately share. This was the hardest time for me. There\\u2019s no way to really deal with this except to remember it. Also, in late January when the outbreak first exploded \\u2026 seeing all the messages online of people asking for help and the huge gap between what was being reported in the news and what was really happening also caused a lot of mental pressure.

Cruise ship arrivals will also be banned for at least 30 days, Scott Morrison announced on Sunday, amid escalating efforts to contain the virus. The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening. A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman \\u2013 a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge \\u2013 died on Saturday. NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57. Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61. Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people. State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made. Penalties in some states include fines of thousands of dollars. The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable. On Friday the Council of Australia Governments decided to advise against \\u201cstatic, non-essential\\u201d mass public gatherings of 500 people or more, to apply from Monday. The advice has been upgraded to a ban although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger \\u201cwidescale\\u201d closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces. \\u201cWe will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,\\u201d Morrison said. \\u201cAll people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days. \\u201cFurther, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.\\u201d Morrison said that \\u2013 until now \\u2013 self-isolation had been a \\u201cvoluntary arrangement\\u201d with \\u201cno potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement\\u201d. \\u201cThat will change,\\u201d he said, although penalties would be \\u201ca matter for the states and territories\\u201d. \\u201cIf your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.\\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state\\u2019s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made. Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday\\u2019s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved. But she said it would be difficult to monitor \\u201cevery situation\\u201d and the government would be relying on \\u201cpublic goodwill\\u201d to ensure the rules were followed and the government would \\u201cprefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation\\u201d. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,\\u201d Berejiklian said. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000. \\u201cTo date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,\\u201d she said. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included \\u201csevere fines\\u201d, for people who breached the self-isolation rules. By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing. \\u201cThe states and territories \\u2026 are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.\\u201d Morrison said the government\\u2019s national information campaign \\u201cis running and it will be available to all Australians\\u201d but claimed that social distancing was \\u201cpretty straightforward\\u201d. He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean \\u201censuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they\\u2019re close family and friends\\u201d. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all commonsense.\\u201d For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them. \\u201cIf we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,\\u201d he said. Morrison foreshadowed that there \\u201cwill be further intrusions, further restrictions on people\\u2019s movement and their behaviour\\u201d in future in response to changes in medical advice. The first of these will be new protocols for visiting aged care facilities, he said, with further work to be done to protect remote communities in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that school closures are regarded as inevitable, prompting many schools and universities to prepare for shutdowns. But Morrison said there were \\u201cvery good reasons\\u201d against moving to \\u201cbroadscale closures of schools\\u201d at this point. Although it may seem counterintuitive, schools should stay open at this time because taking children out may expose others to risk and would \\u201cput at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community\\u201d, he said. \\u201cThe states and territories are not moving in that direction.\\u201d The issue will be revisited at meetings of the national cabinet on Tuesday and Friday, although individual schools in Victoria and NSW have been allowed to close \\u201cbased on the cases presented there in the circumstances that exist in those communities\\u201d, he said. Earlier on Sunday Murphy and the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that as advice changes, measures might escalate to include general lockdowns. \\u201cIt \\u2013 it is potential that could be the case,\\u201d Murphy told ABC\\u2019s Insiders. \\u201cBut that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.\\u201d Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: \\u201cPotentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.\\u201d Labor has criticised the government for the slow pace of rolling out a national information campaign, and on Sunday the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for further support for the aviation sector, which missed out on funding in the $1bn regional and community fund. \\u201cWhile these measures are necessary for public health, the federal government must urgently address the significant consequences for our aviation sector,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWith conditions changing rapidly and no end in sight, the federal government must urgently provide all necessary support to ensure Australia has a vibrant aviation sector once the coronavirus outbreak has passed.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 1273}, {\"title\": \"With the closure of another club space, the scene that revived Berlin is being lost | Michael Scaturro\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/club-closure-berlin-dance-east-west-germany-gentrification\", \"content\": \"I was in bed when my friend Alfonso called me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the last party at Griessmuehle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the last Cocktail there. Throw on some clothes. We\\u2019re going.\\u201d Cocktail d\\u2019Amore is one of a handful of landmark Berlin parties that have made the German capital a centre of LGBTQ+ youth culture over the past two decades. It took place in a venue called Griessmuehle, an old East German grain mill that people enjoyed because one moment you might be kissing on shower tiles, the next dancing in a silo. Sadly, it is to be demolished this spring to make space for a resort hotel. It certainly wasn\\u2019t an architectural jewel like the Berlin Philharmonic concert hall or Museum Island \\u2013 but clubs, along with cheap studio space and vibrant subcultures, are what made Berlin the city so many love today. In the 1990s, Berlin still conjured up thoughts of the second world war for many Europeans. Rarely did people come here to dance. But then something miraculous happened: the city\\u2019s empty buildings provided the global queer community with a home where low rents and large studio spaces drew in creatives from around the world. Artists and musicians turned cavernous buildings into dance clubs, and those dance clubs were fabulous. This helped resuscitate Germany\\u2019s image abroad, because Berliners showed they could welcome a diverse group of people and allow these creatives to help remake the city for a new century. That\\u2019s why now it is so distressing that club spaces are closing or under threat as Berlin\\u2019s gentrification intensifies. Despite the fact that clubs in the city draw 3 million tourists a year, and generate nearly \\u20ac1.5bn (\\u00a31.3bn) in annual revenue, more than 100 venues have closed over the past 10 years as property prices have more than doubled. In addition to Griessmuehle, About Blank, Else and Wilde Renate are facing closure as officials push for the building of highways and luxury housing developments on parcels of land that investors once shunned. Cocktail d\\u2019Amore has found a new venue, but if this pattern continues the city\\u2019s parties will inevitably run out of venues. In the early years of reunification, East and West German youths met for the first time, danced together and formed lifelong friendships in ramshackle Berlin clubs staged in former bank vaults, disused kindergartens and collapsing supermarkets. Clubs served as a kind of neutral ground on which the two societies could recombine. The soundtrack was often provided by African American GIs who were stationed in Germany, or Germans who came back home after living in London and New York. They inspired a new generation of homegrown DJs with their house and techno records. Berlin\\u2019s economy never really took off in the 90s, meaning low rents continued into the 00s, making it an appealing prospect for artists and creatives looking to escape unaffordable lives in other major cities. Still, when I first spent time in Berlin over a decade ago, locals continually asked me why I would ever want to live there. Apparently I was experiencing their city in a way they weren\\u2019t. In the late 90s, two gay German entrepreneurs started Ostgut, the forerunner to Berghain, their now wildly successful, internationally renowned club. No story about Berlin\\u2019s transformation into a queer mecca can be told without recounting the tale of Berghain. But since that\\u2019s been rehashed so often, I\\u2019ll just explain how I think it fits into the larger narrative. At first, Ostgut suffered the same fate as Griessmuehle today. It was a venue living on borrowed time, in a rented warehouse that would later be yanked down and turned into a sports arena. When it reopened in 2004, inside a former power station straddling the no-man\\u2019s neighbourhood that was the Friedrichshain/Kreuzberg border, Berghain\\u2019s owners set about buying the building to assure their club\\u2019s longevity. It was a smart move because, as anyone who has seen this parcel of land knows, Berlin\\u2019s growth as a city ended up taking place around Berghain: in the span of 15 years, a Metro superstore, a shopping mall, hotels and offices sprang up next door. But because the owners managed to buy the property, Berghain is still here. Moreover, its arts programming during the week has cemented its place in the city\\u2019s cultural life. And it has been willing to take on the city (and win) when it feels wronged. The city\\u2019s tax court agreed with Berghain that VAT on the club\\u2019s weekend musical programming \\u2013 essentially the door price \\u2013 should be set at a rate of 7% (like opera and classical music events) rather than at 19% (like movies and other goods). Though the ruling applies to all clubs now, the 12% margin has made a life-or-death difference for queer spaces throughout the city. The model that Berghain perfected shows there is a way to protect queer spaces in major cities. Can we help more spaces adopt that model? As we danced inside Griessmuehle\\u2019s underground pit for the last time, I felt sad that we as a queer community have let another one of our spaces slip away, just as happened in New York and London. It\\u2019s all the more sad, then, to see marketing materials for luxury apartment buildings or corporate event planners selling clients a Berlin lifestyle that they are so instrumental in damaging.

Even when historians began affording greater texture to the Indigenous experience in the mid-20th century (novelists and dramaturgs would follow), popular distorted myths about some of the most important Aboriginal people of colonial times nonetheless persisted. Bennelong is still fallaciously recounted as an obstreperous drunk who ultimately fitted in with neither his people nor with the colonists. Bungaree\\u2019s epic part in Matthew Flinders\\u2019 circumnavigation and his unofficial role as emissary to the invaders is often eclipsed by his later descent into drunkenness (in a colony whose currency was grog), ill health and vagrancy. And then there is Truganini, storied incorrectly as \\u201cthe last of the Tasmanian Aboriginal race\\u201d, a Nuenonne woman from one of the Earth\\u2019s most beautiful realms \\u2013 the paradise off the south-east coast of Tasmania that became Bruny Island. Truganini\\u2019s life has frequently been crafted into something of a three-act \\u201ctragedy\\u201d \\u2013 a trope that focuses, first, on her idyllic early life and European disruption; second, on her dispossession from country; and third, her 1876 death at Oyster Cove near Hobart and the later display of her remains in a cabinet at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. So very much else that came between has been forgotten or gone untold. Tragedy, of course \\u2013 as Emma Dortins wrote in relation to Bennelong \\u2013 \\u201cis not life or history\\u201d. Indeed, tragedy is a dramatic reinterpretation of the peaks and troughs \\u2013 a precis \\u2013 of both, with all of the rounding out of story and the honing off of the barnacles of human experience that impede smooth narrative. The Tasmanian historian and writer Cassandra Pybus pushes the historiographical boundary on Truganini. She does a profound service to the complex life of this remarkable woman with her new biography, Truganini: Journey Through the Apocalypse. Pybus ventures beyond the tragic trope that has defined Truganini, the sadness surrounding her death and the horror of the exhumation and display of her remains by the Royal Society of Tasmania. This was part of Truganini\\u2019s life and postmortem, of course. But Pybus brings so much more of Truganini\\u2019s experience to the page. She gives us her story of survival and at times unimaginable physical endurance in what Pybus aptly describes as an apocalypse (Ria Warrawah \\u2013 the intangible force of evil unleashed with European arrival \\u2013 to Truganini\\u2019s Nuenonne people) that descended upon the first Tasmanians post-invasion. Their world was upended. Under the governor George Arthur martial law was declared as the colony tried to rid itself \\u2013 through war, ongoing massacres and poisonings, and later the absurdly ineffective \\u201cblack line\\u201d \\u2013 of Tasmania\\u2019s First Peoples. Pybus presents Truganini\\u2019s life as one of resilience and of adaptation to precarious pathways through dispossession. It shows her negotiating the sexual demands of the violent sealers and others, and of the traditions she managed to cling to \\u2013 including marriage to Wooredy \\u2013 despite the constant infringements of colonialism\\u2019s avaricious commodification of land, resources and Indigenous bodies. The figure \\u2013 and the rich archive \\u2013 of George Augustus Robinson, a self-styled missionary who took it upon himself to \\u201cconciliate\\u201d with the Indigenes of Tasmania (and to remove them from their land and herd them into one isolated place) partly informs Pybus\\u2019s Truganini. But where other scholars and writers have mined the Robinson archive for all it says about this perplexing and morally ambiguous man himself, Pybus has drawn from his invaluable, decades\\u2019-long observation of Truganini. Truganini emerges as wholly, spiritually and physically in sync with her natural world, having rejected Christianity despite the efforts of Robinson and others to inculcate her and the others. We learn of the fabulous swimmer who relished diving for crayfish (there\\u2019s an encounter with a shark!). We see a woman who loved children, a desired and desirous lover who took agency where she could, and a canny negotiator with Robinson and the colonial authorities who were pursuing the extinction of her people. Of Truganini\\u2019s possum trapping, for example, Pybus writes: \\u201cShe deftly wove a rope from the long wiry grass and hooked it around the trunk of a tree to pull herself up, cutting notches in the bark for her feet as she ascended. Once in the canopy, she would grab at the possum to knock it to the ground.\\u201d While this communion with nature should be no surprise, Pybus\\u2019s portrayal of that relationship is laced with moving poignancy, her prose about the bounty and wonder of country and Truganini\\u2019s connection to it as lush and beautiful as the land itself. There is a reason for this. Pybus is descended from the colonist who received the biggest freehold land grant on Truganini\\u2019s Nuenonne country. \\u201cWooredy and Truganini compel my attention and emotional engagement because it is to them I owe a charmed existence in the temperate paradise where I now live and where my family has lived for generations,\\u201d she writes. It is a profound hook for an important book that goes a long way towards reinvesting Truganani with all that has been eclipsed by the trope of her \\u201ctragedy\\u201d. \\u2022 Paul Daley is a Guardian Australia columnist.

Polling stations opened on Sunday as planned despite calls for the two-round vote to be postponed as the coronavirus spread. On Saturday evening, the prime minister, \\u00c9douard Philippe, announced the country was moving into stage 3 of its response to the coronavirus emergency and ordered a partial lockdown, including the closure of caf\\u00e9s, bars, restaurants and cinemas. Food shops, tobacconists, pharmacies and public transport will remain open, Philippe said, but transport ministers warned services would be reduced to a minimum this week to try to contain the spread of the virus. French schools and colleges have shut down indefinitely and people are advised to work from home where possible and avoid unnecessary journeys. The decision to shut down non-essential public places came as France reported 4,499 confirmed cases, including 91 deaths, according to the national health agency, Sant\\u00e9 Publique France. At polling stations, voters were advised to keep a \\u201csocial distance\\u201d of one metre apart, to bring their own pens and to disinfect their hands before marking their voting paper. Priority was given to elderly and \\u201cvulnerable\\u201d voters. At midday, participation was 18.38%, five percentage points lower than at the same point during the last municipal elections in 2014. Philippe voted from Le Havre, where is standing for election as mayor. In Paris, the former president Nicolas Sarkozy and the current city mayor, Anne Hidalgo, were among the first to vote. President Emmanuel Macron was expected to vote in his home town at Le Touquet at lunchtime. Anthony Wimbush, a British company director based in Paris, said his local polling station in east of Paris was quiet. \\u201cEveryone was keeping a metre apart and if you\\u2019d forgotten a pen, as I had, they were offering disinfected ones. I saw some people wearing gloves but didn\\u2019t see any masks,\\u201d he said. At the local market, Wimbush said the food stalls were operating as normal, but police closed down a flower stall, considered non-essential. The normally busy Champs \\u00c9lys\\u00e9es in Paris was deserted. One of the most contested municipal battles is in Paris, where opinion polls showed the Socialist Hidalgo remains favourite, closely followed by the mainstream right candidate, Rachida Dati, with Agn\\u00e8s Buzyn, the candidate for the centrist government party, LREM, trailing in third place. Elisabeth Borne, the transport minister, said long distance public transport services would be slowly phased out and that people should avoid all unnecessary journeys. \\u201cOur absolute objective is to slow down the spread of the virus to enable the health services to deal with it in the best way possible,\\u201d Borne said. Jean Baptiste Djebbari, the transport secretary, added that 80% of the M\\u00e9tro in Paris and 100% of buses and trams would run on Monday but services would be slowly reduced over the week. Seven out of 10 intercity and TGV services would run on Monday, reducing to half by the end of next week. Djebbari called for \\u201cdiscipline and good civic behaviour\\u201d. About 47.7 million people, including 330,000 citizens from other EU countries living in France, have the right to vote.

McCarthy found himself, late in life, a new father. Recognising that the time he and his son would have together was limited, he wrote a book about the tribulations the next generation were likely to face, about the courage needed for a son to press on without his dad. Tim Dee\\u2019s Greenery, a joyful, poetic hymn to spring, could hardly be less like McCarthy\\u2019s dystopian novel, but its impulse is the same. At the end of the book, we discover Dee has Parkinson\\u2019s disease, and that his wife, the ornithologist Claire Spottiswoode, is pregnant with their first child. All this makes a book full of echoes and allusions doubly effective and affecting. For while it celebrates spring \\u2013 what the poet Louis MacNeice calls the \\u201cnotwithstanding unique all over all again\\u201d nature of it \\u2013 it sets against the cyclical nature of the seasons the linear unspooling of our own lives. As Dee notes early in the book: \\u201cSpring means more to me with each year that passes and takes me deeper into my own autumn.\\u201d This knowledge \\u2013 of the proximity of death and new life \\u2013 also serves to explain several of the motifs that run throughout the book. Dee, a former BBC radio producer now established as one of our greatest living nature writers, urges us to view his three major books (he rather passes over 2018\\u2019s superb Landfill) as a trilogy. Greenery joins The Running Sky, which was about \\u201cbirds and the sky they occupy\\u201d, and Four Fields, about \\u201cthe elemental matter that we stand on\\u201d. He tells us that Greenery is a book about \\u201cbirds in time and in movement\\u201d, and \\u201chow lovable the world is, above all, when those living things are moving in the world\\u2019s morning and not dead\\u201d. That idea of birds in time and movement is powerfully expressed in several passages. At the start, Dee writes of being in one of the places he calls home \\u2013 Scarborough, on the western edge of South Africa\\u2019s Cape Peninsula. He sees a swallow and it leads him to think of the way he has arranged his life around the movement of the birds. Through swallows, he says: \\u201cI have learned to love the world, and watching them fly, and trying to travel with them, has made the world they know and live in seem lovelier still.\\u201d One is immediately reminded of Horatio Clare\\u2019s beautiful A Single Swallow, in which the author tried (and largely failed) to follow the migration paths of swallows up through Africa to Britain. Here, though, Dee\\u2019s thoughts are turned towards the seasons. \\u201cSpring moves north through Europe at a speed comparable to the swallows\\u2019 flight \\u2013 the right speed for life,\\u201d Dee writes. Then, as if playing a variation on a theme, he figures the movement of spring a different way. Grass begins to grow and insects emerge at a temperature of 10C, he says. The 10C isotherm \\u201cmoves across the landmass of Europe from the Mediterranean to the Arctic Ocean at roughly 50km a day between the winter solstice and the summer solstice\\u2026 Spring, therefore, moves north at about walking pace.\\u201d It\\u2019s a beautiful, hopeful image, and provides a loose kind of template for the book, which journeys idiosyncratically north from South Africa, through Chad and Ethiopia, central Europe and Britain, to Scandinavia, ending up in the far north of Norway, all driven by the author\\u2019s wish \\u201cto be in springtime for as long as possible\\u201d. Later, Dee imagines birds as envoys of spring, \\u201cflying green flags through the seasons\\u201d. The book\\u2019s chapters are arranged by month, then further sub-divided by place, and at the beginning of May, in the deep heart of spring, Dee finds himself in a reed bed in Somerset at dawn, recording the chorus. \\u201cIt is always dawn somewhere,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIn early May, the dawn chorus moves around the northern hemisphere at about 1,300 kilometres per hour. If there is such a thing as godspeed that is it.\\u201d Like so many passages in Greenery, it\\u2019s hard to read this without cheering. Greenery is an education in looking at, and loving, nature. As Dee moves through the world, and the fact of his illness gradually stalks up on him, birds make the strange familiar, the foreign homely. Seeing birds emerge at dusk in a valley in Chad, \\u201cthe space that lived globally a minute ago became intimate\\u201d; Dee\\u2019s guide there, Pier Paolo, was \\u201ca domesticator of the harshest places\\u201d; in his company \\u201cthe desert was made homely\\u201d. Later, buntings warm themselves on the \\u201cblack barrows\\u201d of neolithic tumuli, \\u201cmaking homely the accommodation for the long dead\\u201d. The book\\u2019s pages set up a kind of conversation between spring and autumn, between life and death. Dee laces through his writing the work of others who were creating even as they died: the tubercular DH Lawrence is everywhere, beset by the same ataxic shiftlessness as Dee (\\u201cComes over one an absolute necessity to move,\\u201d Lawrence says). There\\u2019s the singer Kathleen Ferrier, Rimbaud, Katherine Mansfield, Chekhov \\u2013 all dead before their time, all producing great work to the last. Dee makes a trip to Denmark to visit the site of the Tollund Man. It\\u2019s another, older burial that strikes him most powerfully though: a young woman, who most likely died in childbirth, in a grave with her baby lying on a swan\\u2019s wing: \\u201cHer baby had the white swan\\u2019s wing for his death-bed\\u2026 The swan\\u2019s wing is difficult to see and hard to configure in the gentle scatter and sift of shells and teeth and bones. It is like trying to pick out a constellation in the crowded night sky. But when you know it is there, it is what you want to see \\u2013 to see love.\\u201d This love is what the book leaves you with, a gift to the son Dee may not know for long. It is a lesson in how to love the world, in how to look at it, and behind everything there beats a deeper message: that spring cannot exist without winter, that life needs death to define it. At the end of the book, at the end of spring, even in Troms county in the far north of Norway, the birds have stopped singing. Dee sees a family party of willow warblers by a lily pond and writes. \\u201cSinging was now in their heads only. They had heard enough of one another, and for now there was nothing further to say.\\u201d \\u2022 Greenery: Journeys in Springtime by Tim Dee is published by Jonathan Cape (\\u00a318.99).

It\\u2019s easy to imagine senators Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand competing 12 months from now on debate stages across Iowa. But tonight they are tossing beanbags before a cheering young crowd fueled by a pale rose\\u0301 and piles of guacamole. It\\u2019s a celebratory fundraiser for Run for Something, the brainchild of the millennial activists Amanda Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto, which is teaching hundreds of first-time millennial candidates how to get elected to state legislatures, county commissions, school boards and judgeships. Most of them are women or candidates of color; many of them are running in places like Montana, Oklahoma and Arkansas, states in which Democrats have either surrendered or gone plain extinct. \\u201cWe\\u2019re here because people facing incredible odds and insurmountable obstacles kept fighting and kept resisting,\\u201d Booker tells me, \\u201cand figured out what they could do to make a difference.\\u201d And we\\u2019re here because Litman turned anguish into action, channeling her devastation after working seven-day weeks to elect Hillary Clinton toward helping others determined to go from spectator to participant, but lacking any clue where to begin. But as Litman took stock while the pain of Clinton\\u2019s bitter defeat slowly dulled, she realized that what progressive politics needed most was a rebuilt pipeline of young candidates at the state and local level. Republican focus on down-ballot candidates had provided the GOP not just complete control of Washington, but a modern record number of governors and 70% of all state legislative chambers. \\u201cWhen I talk to old white male donors, they say, \\u2018I\\u2019ve thought about running for Congress,\\u2019\\u201d she says, rolling her eyes. \\u201cI\\u2019m like, \\u2018Of course you have.\\u2019 You know who hasn\\u2019t? The young Latina who should.\\u201d Litman quickly conquered the highest summits of electoral politics. She held a historic title: Hillary\\u2019s email director. No, not those emails. Litman directed all the campaign\\u2019s email fundraising efforts and communications. She raised $330m \\u2013 that\\u2019s almost a third of a billion dollars \\u2013 one small donation at a time. The campaign haunted her dreams, and destroyed her health: kidney infections, an ever-present migraine hum. She\\u2019d wake most nights in a cold sweat and reach for her phone to track fundraising numbers. Did I mention that she loved it? It was everything she\\u2019d dreamt about, ever since The West Wing turned her into such a politics-obsessed teenage nerd that she cut class to trail Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards across Virginia during the 2008 Democratic primary. Election night was crushing. The next day, she sat in the third row for Clinton\\u2019s concession speech, eyes red, barely having slept at all, wearing a campaign sweatshirt she wouldn\\u2019t remove. Then a Facebook message arrived from a college classmate she hadn\\u2019t heard from for years, now a teacher in Chicago. \\u201cShe was pissed,\\u201d Litman says. \\u201cShe says, \\u2018If Trump can be president, why can\\u2019t I run for city council?\\u2019\\u201d If her old friend wanted to march for change, then run for office, thousands of other people would have the same desire. They also wouldn\\u2019t know the first steps, and probably wouldn\\u2019t have a Facebook friend with Hillary\\u2019s number in her contacts. \\u201cThere was no infrastructure for this kind of candidate recruitment. None. There was nobody doing it. If we\\u2019re able to do this right,\\u201d Litman says, eyes aglow, \\u201cit\\u2019s sort of a shadow national party with a very explicit focus. Could be cool!\\u201d Two years after the most devastating night of Litman\\u2019s life, election night 2018 looked completely different thanks to Run for Something and related efforts by dynamic young activists, almost all women, some completely new to politics, who upended their lives and left high-paying jobs to rebuild the progressive bench from the ground up. More than 200 Run for Something candidates won state legislative seats, some capturing red-state seats that had been in Republican hands for longer than the young candidates had been alive. That\\u2019s 10% of all 2018 Democratic state house gains, all for just $2.1m, and not much more than the average budget for one US House race. While Run for Something helped funnel enthusiastic candidates into electoral politics, groups like Flippable, Sister District and Forward Majority provided another approach. They focused their efforts on reclaiming the state legislative chambers most crucial for the 2021 redistricting. They targeted blue and purple states which had been under complete GOP control since 2010, such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, Virginia and North Carolina; red states with changing demographics, like Texas and Arizona; and competitive states including Washington and Colorado, where a small number of Democratic gains would be enough to create a blue trifecta. Together, they channeled dollars and volunteers toward these small local races with massive national impact. Republican strategists and donors had long ago unlocked the importance of these elections and built the party\\u2019s national power one state legislative chamber at a time. Republicans captured more than 700 state legislative seats in the 2010 Tea Party wave, then locked in those gains with redistricting, tilting the playing field an even rubier red. In all, Republicans gained more than 1,000 state legislative seats during the Obama years, and used those majorities to enact measures making it more difficult to register to vote or cast a ballot in twenty-five states, further disadvantaging Democrats and consolidating GOP power. \\u201cDemocrats had an entire cycle of losing,\\u201d says Vicky Hausman, the co-founder of Forward Majority. Democrats contested more than 5,300 of the 6,066 state legislative seats up for election in 2018, the highest percentage in more than a decade. In one year, they won back almost 450 of the seats that had washed away over the previous decade. It came bottom-up, as Run for Something, Sister District and Forward Majority delivered energy, candidates and strategic smarts to races that the party ignored. They helped win majorities in the Colorado and New York senate, and eroded GOP majorities in Pennsylvania and Arizona. They cracked a Republican supermajority in North Carolina and significantly improved their party\\u2019s position in Florida, Michigan and Texas, gaining important yardage with one election to go before the next redistricting. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just citizens who have been activated. If our majority \\u2013 our three-million-person majority \\u2013 was engaged in state politics, everything is different,\\u201d says Rita Bosworth, the co-founder of Sister District, which started with a Facebook conversation and now has 30,000 nationwide volunteers organized through sixty-five active teams on the ground. They focused on thirty-two legislative elections \\u2013 and won sixteen of them \\u2013 in nine states where Democrats might flip a chamber or make inroads into gerrymandered GOP majorities. Her three co-founders \\u2013 political director Gabrielle Goldstein, partnerships and engagement director Lala Wu and programs and communication director Lyzz Schwegler \\u2013 came together largely through a secret Facebook group of liberal lawyers established after the 2016 election. By spring, Bosworth, Goldstein and Wu had abandoned successful law careers to save democracy full-time. On election night 2016, tearful in Columbus, Ohio, Flippable\\u2019s Catharine Vaughan found herself coming to a similar conclusion. She had taken a leave from McKinsey and Co and left San Francisco to work for the Hillary campaign and spend months on a host family\\u2019s sofa. When the campaign ended with whiskey and tears, Vaughan planned to head back to consulting and the Bay Area. Over farewell margaritas, the team tried to unpack what had gone wrong and what might come next. The conversation turned to gerrymandering. Ohio is enough of a competitive, bellwether state that they\\u2019d all put their lives on hold, thinking the state\\u2019s electoral votes could decide the presidential election. But Republicans still held a two-to-one edge in the state legislature. Vaughan had spent several years working with the Gates Foundation and others on health problems in east Africa that were completely preventable if the right resources landed in the right places. People in politics are really good at understanding who has power and how to build a web of relationships, Vaughan says, but less skilled at building and judging effective organizations. \\u201cHow do you help them see that maybe the way they\\u2019re giving their money could be optimized?\\u201d Forward Majority\\u2019s Hausman had a similar background; as a partner at the global strategy firm Dalberg, where she led the Americas team and the global health practice, she worked on bringing business-school analysis and smart-data analytics to philanthropy. Rural governments in sub-Saharan Africa lacked the money they needed, for example, to buy and deliver bed nets to citizens before the rainy mosquito season. \\u201cThere are these unsexy barriers that really impact people\\u2019s lives,\\u201d she tells me. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t fix the whole thing, but we can use business strategy and analytics on specific problems that are fixable.\\u201d Turned out, one of those problems was democracy right here at home. Litman believes Democrats need to compete \\u2013 and win \\u2013 everywhere. She\\u2019s after candidates rooted in a community who are committed to getting out there and talking to people. She calls it her \\u201cfuck yeah\\u201d test. Back on that Washington DC, rooftop, a third US senator and potential Democratic nominee, Elizabeth Warren, slides out of the Run for Something bash before the cornhole battle commences. \\u201cThis is the future,\\u201d she tells me quietly, holding her arms open wide before the room. Indeed, if the forty-sixth president of the United States was pitching beanbags that night (or sneaking out early), it hardly seems a stretch to suggest that the forty-ninth or fiftieth might have been there as well, along with future senators and governors and state representatives, all inspired to run, and shown how to do it, by a new generation of activists who reinvented the party where it had been neglected by their elders \\u2013 down ballot, where it matters most.

In an overdue house debut, Louise Alder was an irresistible Susanna, a beautifully judged mix of cartoon coquettishness and emotional depth. Bo\\u017eidar Smiljani\\u0107\\u2019s Figaro was physically imposing but vocally agile, Johnathan McCullough was ideally cast as a fratboy-cum-Count, Hanna Hipp was a joy to behold as a skater boy Cherubino and Susan Bickley a class act as Marcellina. Elizabeth Watts\\u2019 Countess brought real poise to her moments in the spotlight as the opera\\u2019s least comic character. Hill-Gibbins\\u2019 production comes into its own precisely when it ceases to be funny, allowing the brash comedy of infidelity, groping and double standards to fall away. At its shocking climax, the Countess, humiliated by her husband\\u2019s attempt to seduce her while disguised as Susanna, picks herself up and walks slowly \\u2013 painfully slowly \\u2013 away from the audience without looking back. Susanna watches silently, all pity. Minutes later, the final scene (our promised happy ending) is too bright, too loud, too fake, too fast \\u2013 and the mirage evaporates. The Count is left alone, the doors shut against him.

How deadly is it? How do we protect ourselves? Are the government\\u2019s tactics right? And how will the health service cope when \\u2013 and it is when \\u2013 it leaves large numbers of people seriously ill, many fighting for their lives? These questions are even more pressing for us because within two weeks we will be part of the frontline against a threat that we\\u2019ve never seen the like of before. I\\u2019m worried that our hospital\\u2019s beds are already 98% full. We are full of \\u201csocial patients\\u201d \\u2013 people medically fit to go but who can\\u2019t be discharged because there isn\\u2019t a place in a care home for them, or the care package to allow them to go home hasn\\u2019t been sorted. So where are all the people needing life-or-death care from Covid-19 going to go? We\\u2019re barely two weeks from being in the same situation as Italy, with huge numbers of people needing to be in hospital. Yet we don\\u2019t have enough protective equipment like masks and goggles. And the NHS is under-staffed. We have to haggle with management about a minuscule pay rise for doctors willing to work extra shifts and expose themselves to danger. We don\\u2019t have enough isolation rooms or ventilators, which will be vital. Intensive care units will be the NHS\\u2019s most precious resource, but ours are close to full most of the time. We\\u2019re told of plans to increase ICU capacity. Yet you need a specially trained nurse for each ICU bed. Where will the extra staff come from? Too few beds, staff and equipment; I\\u2019m worried that the NHS is completely ill-equipped to handle Covid-19. When Boris Johnson talks about our wonderful NHS and how well-prepared it is, that\\u2019s bullshit. He either doesn\\u2019t have a clue or is trying to falsely reassure people. The NHS has been hit hard before, by underfunding, terrorist attacks and tough winters. But usually crises are stretched over a period of time. With coronavirus it will all come at once. The virus\\u2019s effects can vary from a mild flu-like illness to severe pneumonia in both lungs, meaning they no longer provide enough oxygen for the body, so organs get deprived of oxygen and start to fail \\u2013 your kidneys, brain, heart. Many people die of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Dying because you are struggling to breathe is a horrible way to go; it\\u2019s very distressing for the patients, their family and the staff treating them. Relatives will not be able to kiss loved ones goodbye. In Italy, doctors and nurses are videocalling people so they can say farewell. And when staff are overwhelmed emotionally they will not be able to give each other a hug or even put a reassuring arm round the shoulder because of the infection risk. I\\u2019m amazed it has taken the NHS and the government so long to get ready to deal with a crisis. We need to free up doctors and NHS staff to prepare for what\\u2019s coming. We should be cancelling outpatient clinics, suspending waiting-time targets, like the four-hour A&amp;E wait and the 18-week target for outpatient treatment, until this is all over - and be open with the public about why this is happening. Soon the NHS is going to be faced with a huge amount people with Covid-19. So we need to urgently ensure all doctors, not just A&amp;E, intensive care and respiratory doctors, are trained to at least perform the initial assessment and treatment of someone suspected to have the virus. Otherwise we will burn out from overwork and stress; specialists can\\u2019t do it all ourselves. Not to mention that many of us will get the infection ourselves and fall ill or even die, further depleting the workforce. We need doctors and managers to go to hospitals and identify where extra ICU beds can be created. Which operating theatres, anaesthetic rooms and resus areas can be used? And what does doing that mean for patients who come in with cancer, serious injuries or heart disease? What about them? The NHS also needs to get people out of hospital who don\\u2019t need to be there and buy find lots of extra ventilators, though Italy and other countries want them too. We may be lucky. But I fear and expect that we are going to end up in the same situation as Iran and Italy, where health services have struggled to cope. Hospitals have been overwhelmed, unmanageable and unsafe. If that does happen here, doctors will have to decide who is worth saving: an 80-year-old or someone in their 30s or 40s? Those will be impossible decisions. The NHS will have to ration healthcare that could mean the difference between life and death. The virus has wreaked havoc in the north of Italy, the richest part of the country. The health service there \\u2013 one of the best in the world \\u2013 hasn\\u2019t been able to treat everyone who needs care. Some, particularly the elderly, have been left to die. Doctors and nurses have ended up in tears because they can\\u2019t do the job they were trained to do, because of the sheer scale of the crisis. They feel helpless. I\\u2019m worried about a lot of things, especially our ability to care for all the people with severe infections who will need treatment; not just by saving their lives but by ensuring dignity and comfort for people who are dying. I worry that staff will be working flat out, with too few resources, and end up fatigued, sick and broken. And I\\u2019m worried that many people are going to die \\u2013 many avoidably. I\\u2019m appalled and frightened that this might be coming our way. It\\u2019s a catastrophic situation in Italy and Iran. We need to take drastic measures now, and do everything we can, to stop that happening here.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 980}, {\"title\": \"Damning Investigation Finds Jeffrey Epstein Left Unsupervised For Decades Prior To Suicide\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/damning-investigation-finds-jeffrey-epstein-left-unsupe-1837208732\", \"content\": \"Calling the oversight a complete failure of the system on every level, Department of Justice officials told reporters Tuesday that a damning investigation had revealed that billionaire and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein had been left unsupervised for decades prior to his suicide. \\u201cThis high-risk criminal should never have been left alone for any long period of time from the 1990s up until his death,\\u201d said U.S. Attorney General William Barr, expressing his complete shock in discovering that the convicted pedophile was not being checked in on every half hour for the last 30 years. \\u201cWe do have records saying that his actions were being monitored very briefly in 2008, but it obviously wasn\\u2019t enough.

But at this uniquely stressful moment, it really does appear to be true. While they mean well, most leaders haven\\u2019t got a clue. The dawning realisation that national politicians cannot be relied upon to do the right or sensible thing, whatever that may turn out to be, has serious long-term implications for democracy and the principle of democratic consent. If the crisis is protracted, a catastrophic loss of confidence in the way the pandemic is managed could lead to unpredictable social disruption across many countries. As is the case with victims of the disease, underlying conditions and vulnerabilities in politics too are being painfully exposed. It\\u2019s becoming clear, for example, that healthcare systems, even in wealthy countries such as the US, are chronically under-resourced and unprepared. Confusion reigns widely, fuelled by conflicting official advice in different countries about public gatherings, travel, and self-isolation. Some leaders may emerge with their reputations enhanced. For others, the opposite holds true. The virus has already made fools of the world\\u2019s two most powerful men. Xi Jinping, China\\u2019s president, has faced unprecedented criticism over his handling of the first recorded outbreak in Wuhan. He initially steered well clear of the problem \\u2013 an early example of social distancing. But Xi has struggled since to contain the political and human fallout. The death from Covid-19 of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who sounded the alarm in Wuhan in December but was gagged by Communist party officials, sparked an online revolt. Xi finally ventured to the city last week, lavishing praise on its beleaguered residents in what almost sounded like an apology. Predictably, Donald Trump\\u2019s reaction has been all about him. Among other inanities, he suggested the pandemic was a fake Democrat plot to harm his re-election chances. Ignoring the science and minimising the threat, he claimed his Mexican border wall had somehow immunised Americans, and likened the \\u201cforeign virus\\u201d to an alien invasion. It\\u2019s embarrassingly obvious Trump is not up to the job. Both Trump and Xi could pay a heavy price. The US leader may have survived impeachment, but come November many voters will not forget or forgive this failure of leadership in a crisis. Xi\\u2019s aura of paternal infallibility has shattered. Trust has gone. To restore his grip, it is suggested, he may resort to more intrusive social controls, surveillance and censorship. Yet increased repression could prompt a career-ending backlash. Trump\\u2019s knee-jerk reaction in pulling up the drawbridge and blaming others is not unique. Fear not facts has led European leaders such as Austria\\u2019s Sebastian Kurz to act alone, hastily closing borders and barring people from specific countries. These divisions recall Europe\\u2019s chaotic response to the 2015 migrant crisis when governments failed to agree a collective approach. For the European Union, the pandemic is turning into a political nightmare. The commission in Brussels is struggling to keep up, relaxing rules on deficit spending that have already been broken. Piecemeal, national-level policy-making is a gift to Eurosceptics, not least rightwing populists keen to exploit splits, and could have lasting consequences for European cohesion. Public confidence may take a big hit. There\\u2019s no doubt politicians face genuine dilemmas. In Italy, Europe\\u2019s worst-affected state, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was initially attacked for doing too much, by ordering widespread testing in Lombardy, and subsequently for doing too little. What is certain is that Italy has received little help from the rest of Europe \\u2013 the subject of a bitter complaint last week. Now that Italy is in total lockdown, it is being studied like a laboratory guinea pig. Boris Johnson, aware, like other leaders, that his reputation is at stake, treads a fine line between similarly drastic measures and \\u201ckeep calm and carry on\\u201d stoicism. If it all goes wrong, his defence will be that he followed medical advice. Suddenly, experts are back on top in Britain \\u2013 if only as potential fall guys. Many look for leadership to Angela Merkel, Germany\\u2019s unflappable chancellor and Europe\\u2019s most respected politician. Yet her assessment last week, that Covid-19 would infect two out of three Germans and there was not a lot governments could do about it, was less than reassuring. Merkel called for \\u201csolidarity, common sense and open-heartedness\\u201d. But her emphasis on Europe-wide cooperation carried a whiff of hypocrisy. Germany and France have limited exports of protective masks and equipment to safeguard domestic supply \\u2013 hardly an act of solidarity with the neighbours. Nor is Berlin rushing to bail out floundering eurozone partners. The parallel absence of an effective, joined-up global strategy is also casting multilateral institutions in an unflattering light. The World Health Organization, the lead UN agency that might be expected to wield decisive influence, appears strangely diffident at times \\u2013 fearful, perhaps, of provoking a political backlash from heavy-hitters such as China. Global financial institutions are not doing any better. The IMF has thrown $50bn at the problem. Interest rates have been randomly cut and emergency budgets announced. But compared with the 2008 financial crisis, when governments and central banks collaborated to stave off a banking collapse, international coordination to calm markets and reduce risk is lacking. Virus-related economic damage may thus be worse, and longer lasting, than might have been the case. Despite all the angst, the WHO\\u2019s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, complained about \\u201calarming levels of inaction\\u201d by politicians \\u2013 and it seems many governments remain in denial. That may be due to vanity (in the case of North Korea\\u2019s defiantly face-mask-free Kim Jong-un) or incapacity (in the case of poorer countries). Iran repeatedly denied it had a problem, until its leaders started dying. Now it is reportedly digging mass graves. Unscrupulous politicians stand accused of using the pandemic as cover for furtive power-grabs. The timing of last week\\u2019s high-level purge by Saudi Arabia\\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and a constitutional coup by Russia\\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, may be coincidental. Or maybe not. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is manoeuvring to stay on as prime minister, despite his corruption trial and his lack of a parliamentary majority, in the face of what he now deems an exceptional national threat. It\\u2019s conceivable Trump could use new clashes with militia in Iraq to revive his Iran vendetta \\u2013 and distract attention from his viral incompetence. The crisis also raises the danger of governments taking so-called temporary emergency powers and imposing sweeping, illiberal constraints on citizens, journalists and social media that subsequently become permanent. That\\u2019s what happened after the 9/11 convulsion, when the US and allies decided to largely ignore international human rights protections in the name of fighting terrorism. Looked at globally, the politicians\\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive. Yet the fundamental question raised by the pandemic is not one solely for them. It concerns each individual, community, and nation. Will the challenges posed by the virus be allowed to drive us further apart \\u2013 or used to help bring us closer together? The answer hangs in the balance.

The day after International Women\\u2019s Day, shortly before Harvey Weinstein was handed his 23-year jail sentence, and days before Kate Beckinsale outlined a run-in with the rapist movie mogul in which he called her a \\u201ccunt\\u201d for wearing a suit to a premiere, the British lingerie company Agent Provocateur released an underwear campaign celebrating \\u201cthe unparalleled potential of the female physique\\u201d. It opens with a woman\\u2019s bottom and closes with another\\u2019s cleavage. But here\\u2019s the twist. The bottom and breasts belong to four high-profile athletes \\u2013 British gymnast Georgia-Mae Fenton, Canadian pole vaulter Alysha Newman, American climber Sasha DiGiulian and American hurdler Queen Harrison Claye. The four women pole vault, climb and spin for one soft-focused minute in their underwear while Yello\\u2019s Oh Yeah (a song that film critic Jonathan Bernstein describes as \\u201csynonymous with lust\\u201d) provides the ironic soundtrack for us to chuckle along to. Sexy, not sexist! Sarah Shotton, creative director at the British lingerie brand, describes the apparel as \\u201cunder-armour\\u201d and the women \\u201cfeminine as well as athletic\\u201d. The athletes don\\u2019t make eye-contact with the viewer, but the gaze remains external (it\\u2019s worth noting that the creative team behind the ad are all women, and that the women in the adverts all chose what they wore). This is sex rebranded as empowerment, or empowerment reframed as sex. Delivered with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, it also serves as a reminder, in case we needed one, that there really is no movement \\u2013 in this case female empowerment \\u2013 that can\\u2019t be commodified. It suggests that athleticism is an attractive quality, and that while sex sells, so too does strength. The world of athletic prowess, so often coloured in masculine hues, is shown in a different light. Athletes, it turns out, can be sexy. And sexy, we discover, can be athletic. It\\u2019s just... not always easy to see the wood for the tits. Susanna Cordner, senior research fellow at the London College of Fashion, who worked on the V&amp;A\\u2019s 2016-7 exhibition Undressed: a Brief History of Underwear, says the campaign works by flipping two historical tropes in underwear advertising. \\u201cThe first can be traced from 19th-century adverts for corsets that supposedly supported you during exercise, and 1930s campaigns for companies like Charnaux that [used] illustrations of women in action. The implication was that underwear can aid your performance and experience of physical activity.\\u201d The second is using a photograph of a famous figure in a different context, one that reveals another side \\u2013 perhaps a sexier one? It\\u2019s one deployed by Nike and Adidas, and by countless celebrities fronting fashion campaigns. And this is where it gets interesting, says Cordner. Is athletics after this sort of rebrand? Does sprinting in bubblegum satin devalue the act itself? Is this \\u201can empowering message or a piece of progression from past underwear advertising tropes?\\u201d, or all of the above. The societal norms for beauty and sexiness have been changing for years, though the tipping point was, in my mind, the \\u201cAre you beach body ready?\\u201d campaign of 2015 \\u2013 after which point abs on ads became toast. Fashion has yet to agree on what is \\u201cempowering\\u201d, though. Choice seems to be paramount, though for every feminist slogan there was a latex bodysuit (at Saint Laurent), or a bare bottom (in the Bottega Veneta SS20 campaign). The #MeToo movement has attempted to crystallise this, bumping overtly sexual dressing into limbo and turning awards season red carpets (formerly curated, as Beckinsale discovered, by Weinstein) black. But it\\u2019s arguably underwear that has seen the biggest change post-#MeToo. See Kim Kardashian\\u2019s brand, Skims, and Rihanna\\u2019s Savage X Fenty line, which both feature underwear in a range of sizes and muted colours, alongside Heist, another hip new name in the underwear game, which goes one step further with a call to arms: \\u201cShapewear is anti-feminist, right?\\u201d. Wrong! Almost half their sales come from shapewear. Myriam Couturier, a fashion academic at Ryerson University in Toronto, isn\\u2019t convinced. Citing other brands such as Glossier and Outdoor Voices, she claims brands broadcasting a message of acceptance and empowerment are merely \\u201ctrying to get women to continue spending money on fashion and beauty, [while] attempting to give them a sense of agency\\u201d. The context may differ but the product hasn\\u2019t \\u2013 it has simply been rebranded. Like many a fashion brand, Agent Provocateur has used risqu\\u00e9 marketing to get attention through provocation. The clue is in the name. This approach served it well in those apathetic 1990s (it launched in 1994) and noughties. And since nothing is resistant to rebranding, here we are now with #Metoo. It\\u2019s hard to think about Agent Provocateur without pivoting back to its bigger, creepier cousin Victoria\\u2019s Secret, a company that weaponised the million-dollar bra and turned the female form into content. That brand has now cancelled its shows, and seen one of its company founders linked to Jeffrey Epstein, but its ghost continues to haunt the industry. Serena Rees, Agent Provocateur\\u2019s co-founder, recently launched a gender-fluid brand, Les Girls Les Boys, by way of repudiation of what she created. Her new venture is, she told the New York Times, \\u201ca reaction to the social and political climate we are currently living in\\u201d. What was acceptable in the past is now seen as embarrassing, even shameful, and requires some form of atonement. What Agent Provocateur is conscious of, I imagine, is being deemed exploitatively sexy in a world that is beginning to tackle exactly that. Knowing we wouldn\\u2019t buy an earnest International Women\\u2019s Day video, it did it another way. The campaign isn\\u2019t quite as absurd as oil giant Shell saying it would rebrand as She\\u2019ll for International Women\\u2019s Day, but the intention is clear: yes, lingerie advertising has a history of turning women into sexualised objects but look, we\\u2019ve turned our women into protagonists.

Despite being a Yorkshire lass herself, brought up in the market town of Ilkley, she found the concept hilarious. \\u201cWhy, when you have all the causes in the world, why would you choose to fight for a Yorkshire parliament?\\u201d It is all the more surprising, then, that come June 2017, the writer and director ended up standing in the general election as Yorkshire party candidate, complete with a homemade rosette, mini-manifesto and barnstorming stump speech, demanding an end to two-party politics. \\u201cImagine you could only ever listen to Ed Sheeran or Cliff Richard,\\u201d she told one hustings. \\u201cYou\\u2019d stop listening to music, wouldn\\u2019t you? Why, then, do we have that system in politics?\\u201d Almost three years on, Seddon has written a musical about the whole surreal experience. Say Yes to Tess, opening shortly at the Leeds Playhouse, follows her journey from sneering ironicist to paid-up political reformer as she found meaning in joining an arguably hopeless fight for a different future. Seddon, now 33, stars in and directs the show, which tells the true story of her attempt to make political history in the constituency of Leeds North East. Standing for MP had never been in her life plan. Originally, she just wanted to write a play about \\u201cthese crazy amateur politicians\\u201d who had their eyes on a very niche goal: the annexing of God\\u2019s own country from the rest of England. Things changed when she went \\u201cundercover\\u201d at the Yorkshire party\\u2019s political conference. She was soon rumbled as an interloper when asked what her favourite Yorkshire film was and said Kes. Apparently, Ken Loach\\u2019s rather bleak tale of a bullied boy and his kestrel best friend was not the right answer for a movement celebrating the majesty rather than misery of the historic county: \\u201cThey went nuts.\\u201d She had spent much of the morning \\u201csniggering\\u201d with an undercover reporter from Buzzfeed. But, come the afternoon, in a session about policymaking, something changed. \\u201cSuddenly I was like: look at all these disparate people coming together figuring out how they would run the world! I felt really moved. Half of me was like: this is completely stupid, they are never going to be in power. But then I looked at myself and thought: what am I doing to change things?\\u201d Seddon developed the play on-and-off until April 2017, when Theresa May called a snap general election and she spotted a tweet from the Yorkshire party asking for candidates. \\u201cAnd I thought that was really funny. What political party gets candidates by just doing an open call? So I tweeted: \\u2018Go on, stand!\\u2019 as a joke to my followers. Then the party immediately messaged me saying: \\u2018We\\u2019d love you to stand.\\u2019\\u201d She met party hacks at a cafe in Leeds and told them that, actually, her plan was to write a play about other people throwing their hat in the ring. \\u201cBut then they said. \\u2018Well, why don\\u2019t you stand?\\u2019 And they said, \\u2018Do you feel represented in the current political system?\\u2019 And I said no.\\u201d They told her: \\u201cYou can do as much or as little campaigning as you like. We just want a name on the ballot.\\u201d As a Labour supporter, she worried about spitting the vote: \\u201cI said, \\u2018Well, I wouldn\\u2019t want to get 50 votes and then Labour lost by 50 votes.\\u2019 But the Yorkshire party said, \\u2018That won\\u2019t happen because no one will vote for you. No one wastes their vote in the general election.\\u2019\\u201d She laughs. \\u201cThen I went away and thought, \\u2018What an amazing, mad opportunity.\\u2019 And I thought, \\u2018Why not?\\u201d It wasn\\u2019t long before she wondered if she was making a terrible mistake. She received an email from Daniel Gascoigne, whom she calls \\u201cthe Justin Bieber of the Yorkshire party. I think he was about 19 and standing in Pontefract, helped by his nan. He said he got an email from the campaign manager of Labour in my area, asking me to drop out.\\u201d Ukip had announced it wouldn\\u2019t contest Leeds North East, prompting Labour to panic that Ukip\\u2019s votes would all go to the Conservatives. This would imperil Labour\\u2019s Fabian Hamilton, who had been the constituency\\u2019s MP since the Blair landslide of 1997. \\u201cSo suddenly I was thinking, \\u2018Oh my gosh, what have I done?\\u2019\\u201d But she was at the point of no return. The Yorkshire party had paid her \\u00a3500 deposit and she was on the ballot. She considered putting out a flyer saying, \\u201cDon\\u2019t vote for me!\\u201d but decided to carry on. \\u201cI thought, \\u2018Right, well, I\\u2019d rather do something hopeful and actually figure what I stand for and what I want from the world.\\u201d The party partnered her with its \\u201cbest door-knocker\\u201d, a physics teacher and railway enthusiast called Dr Bob Buxton. \\u201cHe knocks on, like, 200 a day and his wife meets him with a sandwich halfway through.\\u201d Then she got the courage up to go out alone \\u2013 and was astonished by the reaction. \\u201cI\\u2019d ask people, \\u2018Do you feel represented by Westminster?\\u2019 And every single person said no.\\u201d No one was rude to her and one woman even offered her a fiver. \\u201cI think she felt sorry for me. She thought I was very brave having my face on a flyer.\\u201d The campaign quickly took on meaning: \\u201cIt started becoming this real, galvanising thing. Suddenly, from being fairly apathetic, I started believing in my power to change things and, actually, everybody\\u2019s power to take part and participate in our democracy, for all its flaws.\\u201d The only sinister moment came after a hustings. A man came up to her and said: \\u201cVery well done, but you better not be taking Fabian\\u2019s votes.\\u201d She told him: \\u201cActually, I don\\u2019t really believe anyone owns anyone\\u2019s votes.\\u201d Then, she claims, he leaned into her and whispered: \\u201cWe know where you live.\\u201d There is no suggestion that this person was a Labour official and, in the end, Hamilton increased his majority to almost 17,000. Seddon polled 303 votes, better than the Alliance for Green Socialism and the Christian People\\u2019s Alliance. Was it worth it? \\u201cI still don\\u2019t know. I think it\\u2019s more a question for audiences to go home and think about. But I think the lesson I learned was that the most hopeful thing you can do is take part.\\u201d \\u2022 Say Yes to Tess is at Leeds Playhouse, 26 March-4 April.

Last week his production company said it had signed a deal with streaming giant Netflix to develop non-English language films from parts of Africa, initially focused on Nigerian and Sudanese work. \\u201cIt\\u2019s important that we take charge of telling our stories, and with this deal, we will do just that,\\u201d wrote the actor, of British-Nigerian heritage. His mission chimes with the brilliant Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich\\u2019s recent announcement that she will launch a publishing house specifically for other female authors this year (\\u201cMen, they are everywhere, and women\\u2019s works are rarely published,\\u201d she told the Nasha Niva website). Stormzy, having already founded a record label, joined Penguin Random House to launch the #Merky imprint: the only prerequisite for the titles it publishes are that the authors are \\u201cfrom under-represented communities\\u201d. Similarly, the novelist Nikesh Shukla co-founded the Good Literary Agency for talent that otherwise might be excluded. The shift from creating content to encouraging and amplifying the voice of others is not a new one. It isn\\u2019t surprising that those who love films, books or music enough to devote their lives to making them would want to ensure that the world has more of the best. The Beatles used their Apple label to release the likes of Mary Hopkin. What\\u2019s striking about the recent initiatives is that they are not only sharing work they appreciate, but are explicitly promoting the work of people who have been marginalised or ignored by industry gatekeepers. They are not only fostering talent, but recognising it, even when it comes in forms that might seem unfamiliar to others. Cultural production is still dominated by a very narrow sector of society, whose dominance has arguably increased in recent years. A 2018 report concluded that people with working-class origins are still underrepresented in the arts, and that the people at the top (mostly middle-class white men) were the most attached to the idea that the creative industries are a meritocracy. The question is not only who we get to see or hear, but what stories we are told. Research commissioned by BookTrust found that only 2% of British children\\u2019s book creators published in the UK were from a BAME background \\u2013 helping to explain why only 1% of books surveyed in 2017 had a black or Asian lead character. Projects like Boyega\\u2019s or Alexievich\\u2019s are, obviously, good news for the writers or actors who reach an audience previously denied them. But their generosity stretches beyond that which they extend to their colleagues.

On the one hand, it\\u2019s an account of her becoming the first female literary editor of US Esquire at the end of the 90s. On the other, it\\u2019s really about her relationship with David Foster Wallace, then arguably the pre-eminent American novelist of his generation until his death in 2008. The paradox (for a feminist reader, anyway) is that, while you want to celebrate the story of a woman carving out a space in a culture of male entitlement, there\\u2019s no escaping the guilty sense that the book becomes a great deal more lively once the famous male writer takes centre stage. Miller is well aware of this, of course. Much of the book is about the gradual formation of her feminist awareness and the tensions inherent in her professional position (a male colleague tells her \\u201ceveryone wondered\\u201d whom she had slept with to get the job). Suddenly, at 25, she finds herself with a certain amount of power in the literary world \\u2013 \\u201cEsquire had been the chief platform for American short fiction from the 40s through the 70s\\u201d \\u2013 while on the other side of the equation are male writers who can\\u2019t even comprehend the notion of taking editorial suggestions from a woman. One of \\u201cthe most famous and successful authors in the world\\u201d responds to her edits via his agent: \\u201cWHY is this person bothering me with this? Tell her the story is FINISHED.\\u201d \\u201cNow, my sensitivity about the ways in which male writers represented female characters \\u2013 or, in the case of male journalists who wrote for men\\u2019s magazines, how they represented actual women \\u2013 was ever increasing,\\u201d she writes of her early tenure at the magazine, weighing up her aesthetic versus her ideological responsibility. \\u201cIt was not my job to be a censor. But I also knew that I needed the women in what I read to be as clever and as dumb, as noble and as wicked, as any man.\\u201d This may seem glaringly obvious now, but it\\u2019s easy to forget how far the literary culture of the late 90s lionised certain male voices, and how much character it must have taken for a young woman to assert her independence of thought against men who barely believed such a thing could exist. Wallace tells her his favourite Updike line is: \\u201cYou never know for sure how girls\\u2019 minds work (do you really think it\\u2019s a mind in there or just a little buzz like a bee in a glass jar?)\\u201d This is not the first nor the last abhorrently sexist thing Wallace says to her. He begins stalking Miller (there\\u2019s no other way to describe it) when she accepts a story of his for the magazine. He calls her several times a day to discuss his work, then asks for her home number so he can call her at the weekends. He consistently puts her down and patronises her; he is deliberately cruel and simultaneously needy. In the book, she is curiously reticent about the shift in their relationship from professional to personal. Miller tries at times to confront his behaviour, but she offers frustratingly vague analyses of why her younger self found ways to excuse it every time. \\u201cWas I along for the ride? Yes, I guess you could say that I was.\\u201d Ironically, it was Wallace who coined the phrase \\u201cgreat male narcissists\\u201d in a takedown of Updike, and Miller notes that most essays Wallace wrote about other writers were really \\u201cnotes to self\\u201d. But too often she finds a way to blame herself for his narcissism; when he breaks up with her (and behaves like a spoilt brat), she thinks: \\u201cHis life is worth more than mine.\\u201d Her relationship with him comes to seem one more manifestation of the way men treated her professionally (\\u201cThe truth: my career had been built around protecting male egos\\u201d). In one section she lists examples of the things men said or did to her in a professional context, ranging from creepy innuendos to putting their hands down her trousers \\u2013 a reminder, in these post-#MeToo days, that there was a time when sexual harassment was so pervasive that women didn\\u2019t know how to recognise it. Wallace even jokingly suggests that \\u201cIs It Sexual Harassment Yet?\\u201d should be the title of her memoir. \\u201cHad I actually been involved in an abusive relationship with David?\\u201d she wonders, towards the end of the book, but stops short of answering with the unequivocal \\u201cYes!\\u201d that the reader is by now shouting, while rolling their eyes. Her tone is more often one of adulation: \\u201cDavid was an artist rare and true, and we needed him to write. We needed him to hold a mirror up to ourselves and tell us who we were.\\u201d But when she holds a mirror up to him, the appeal is difficult to see at this distance. \\u201cWho looks to the artist\\u2019s life for moral guidance anyway?\\u201d she asks, rhetorically, naming a number of brilliant men who turned out to be monsters, but it sounds like an ambivalent defence of that tired cliche, the troubled male genius. Whether the book brings us closer to understanding Wallace or his work is debatable, but it is disappointing that in a memoir about a woman\\u2019s progress in a man\\u2019s world, it is his presence that dominates. \\u2022 In the Land of Men by Adrienne Miller is published by Ecco (\\u00a320)\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 917}, {\"title\": \"Caroline Dubois leads boxers fighting on at London\\u2019s last sporting stand\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/15/caroline-dubois-leads-boxers-fighting-on-at-londons-last-sporting-stand\", \"content\": \"\\u201cNo, no.

As they danced around the rings and attempted to obliterate their foes, the message from all was clear: there is no time to think about viruses when you are trying to avoid being punched in the face. The number of paying fans in the multicoloured seats in Stratford amounted to a few handfuls in a room otherwise consumed by the vast rows of boxers and coaches, who yelled tactics and cheered their countrymen and women. The format was three rounds and on Saturdayafternoon, the delirious tempo of the contest added an even more stressful edge. In a country consumed by coronavirus, the Copper Box formed a tightly sealed bubble from reality. The only reflection of the current news cycle was the sight of one member of the Kosovo team who arrived at the arena with a surgical mask covering his face.

Bloodied cuts lined her face, but Pita\\u2019s words were laced with joy as she discussed the feeling of defeating a professional. \\u201cThe way that I won showed that I\\u2019m good also,\\u201d she said. The focal point of the opening afternoon was the precocious 19-year-old Caroline Dubois of Great Britain, who won the Youth Olympic games in 2018 and remains unbeaten. Dubois\\u2019s attempt to reach the Tokyo Olympic games marks her senior debut and she had to overcome Ala Staradub, a scrappy Belarusian, to start her career on the right foot. \\u201cIt was definitely as tough as I expected it to be,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI believe that in senior level all the girls are good. There\\u2019s no rubbish girls, there\\u2019s no low-level girls. They\\u2019ve all got winning power, they\\u2019ve all got experience. That\\u2019s what boxing is all about. I\\u2019ve been in tough fights where I get thrown on the floor. I know exactly what it\\u2019s like.\\u201d Dubois\\u2019s origin story squarely reflects her relentlessness. She is the younger sister of British heavyweight champion, Daniel Dubois, and it took a while to convince her family that she should follow in his footsteps. When they relented, they devised a cunning plan, presenting her as a boy named Colin because even though she was born in 2001 girls were still not allowed to train in certain spaces.

To be the best you gotta beat the best and I believe I have the ability to beat the best.\\u201d The hope is that Dubois will be able to put her belief into action in the coming days but recent events have demonstrated how quickly things can change. Until then, life continues within the Copper Box and it is only fitting that boxers are the remaining athletes still grinding away.

Because the press conference that I saw from the Japanese prime minister didn\\u2019t exactly fill me full of confidence that these Games are going to go ahead whatsoever.\\u201d Learmonth\\u2019s comments come as the Diamond League is set to be the latest sporting event to be affected by Covid\\u201119. An athlete who was due to compete in one of the two Diamond League meetings in China in May has told the Guardian that both are \\u201c100% off\\u201d \\u2013 while the season opener in Doha in April is also expected to be postponed or cancelled in the coming days. \\u201cWe have to be realistic,\\u201d said Learmonth, who reached the world championships semi-finals in 2017 and believes that, at 27, he is in the best shape of his life. \\u201cIf the British government are saying the peak is going to hit us around May or June there might not even be any Olympic trials. The Australians have already had theirs cancelled and I fear that this is going to be happening a lot throughout Europe as the weeks and months go by. \\u201cI\\u2019d be happy if they postponed until at least October \\u2013 or maybe later to 2021 or 2022. At least that would give the athletes time to now plan, train, and more importantly, time for this virus to settle down.\\u201d Martyn Rooney, who has spearheaded Britain to one Olympic and three world 4x400m relay medals, also urged the IOC and World Athletics to provide greater clarity \\u2013 especially if Tokyo does go ahead. \\u201cI think most athletes are pragmatic and aware that the health and well\\u2011being of not only the athletes but the teams around them are most important,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf a mass participation event is a high risk then the Olympics is not going to happen and as athletes there\\u2019s nothing we can do about it. \\u201cThe worry is it goes ahead and athletes haven\\u2019t got the chance to qualify. I\\u2019d be pissed off if I knew I\\u2019m in great shape and I didn\\u2019t get the chance to race in good meets and get the necessary time and points to qualify.\\u201d Rooney\\u2019s comments came after it was announced that the Olympic flame handover in Athens next week would be held behind closed doors because of coronavirus concerns. But the Japan prime minister, Shinzo Abe, insisted over the weekend that the Games will go ahead as planned in July. Dai Greene, the 2011 400m hurdles world champion, has told the Guardian he agreed with Rooney \\u2013 and that the IOC and World Athletics must show more flexibility to allow athletes to qualify if required. \\u201cCurrently there are a lot of unknowns for athletes,\\u201d said Greene, who has had to cancel his training camp in Florida and will not be able to compete during the US season. \\u201cIf we cannot compete internationally or domestically during the next few months then a lot of athletes will not be able to qualify for Tokyo. That\\u2019s regardless of whether the Games will go ahead at all.\\u201d Greene also warned that many athletes were worried about the financial implications of not being able to compete. \\u201cLarge portions of the athletics community are not funded or are not funded enough to make a living. We don\\u2019t have clubs who give us wages, we have nothing to fall back on, it\\u2019s a worrying time.\\u201d Meanwhile World Athletics has insisted it would adapt its qualification system if more events were cancelled in the weeks and months ahead. \\u201cAthletics is in a relatively good position because we have a very flexible system and the qualification period began more than 10 months ago,\\u201d a spokesperson insisted. \\u201cWe still have two months to go before the international outdoor season begins in earnest and much can change in that time, as it has in the last two months. \\u201cWhile many international events are being cancelled, some athletes will still be able to do further qualifying competitions in their own countries over the coming months,\\u201d they said. \\u201cWe will publish a full \\u2018Road to the Olympic Games\\u2019 tracking tool on our website by the end of March to help athletes to see where they stand. If the cancellation of events and restrictions on travel begin to disadvantage certain countries or athletes, we will adjust it, and we will also assess any individual cases that are brought to us.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 887}, {\"title\": \"School Shooter Thankfully Stopped Before Doing Enough Damage To Restart National Gun Debate\", \"url\": \"https://local.theonion.com/school-shooter-thankfully-stopped-before-doing-enough-d-1838201037\", \"content\": \"Praising those who had leapt into action to prevent the incident from escalating, relieved authorities announced Wednesday that they had thankfully stopped a school shooter before he did enough damage to restart the national gun debate. \\u201cWe\\u2019re all certainly glad that the shooter was only able to kill two students and injure a teacher before law enforcement arrived and prevented it from becoming a full-blown national dialogue,\\u201d said police chief Walter McMurray, adding that his department\\u2019s quick response ensured that tens of millions of Americans could sleep soundly knowing that they\\u2019d never have to discuss this particular shooting. \\u201cWhile it\\u2019s tragic that the shooter was able to cause two vigils, we\\u2019re grateful that it wasn\\u2019t quite enough carnage to spark any protests or plunge the nation into another week of discussing what we should about this.

The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has proposed the Morrison government allow the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security to review the criteria to ensure they are fit for purpose. The massacre of 49 people at two mosques in Christchurch in March 2019 prompted calls for greater social cohesion in Australia and a renewed focus on extreme rightwing terrorism, particularly by the Labor party. In October Australia\\u2019s spy agency warned extreme rightwing terrorism had become \\u201cmore cohesive and organised\\u201d \\u2013 a warning repeated in February. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, was soon after criticised for promoting a false equivalence between radical far-right groups and \\u201cleftwing terrorism\\u201d. The United States and Britain have listed extreme rightwing groups as terrorist organisations. Dutton has said he will do the same if the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation recommends it. Listing an organisation on the terrorism list criminalises membership or association with the group. Keneally has told Nine newspapers that Asio\\u2019s warnings about rightwing extremists seemed inconsistent with the fact no rightwing groups were on the terrorist list. \\u201cIt may be that the criteria for listing organisations in Australia isn\\u2019t fit-for-purpose when it comes to rightwing extremism,\\u201d Keneally reportedly said. \\u201cFor example, the definition of terrorism in Australia and the UK is similar but with a stark difference: the UK definition of terrorism explicitly extends to violent acts or threats made for the purpose of advancing a racial cause. \\u201cThe Australian government and all federal parliamentarians must now take the terrorist threat of rightwing extremism seriously and respond.\\u201d Keneally suggested the joint committee could review the criteria for listing terrorist organisations, a bipartisan move that would ensure parliamentarians don\\u2019t \\u201cplay politics or engage in culture wars over such issues\\u201d. \\u201cKeeping Australians safe is too important for that.\\u201d In a statement on Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia \\u201cstands in unity and solidarity with New Zealand on the first anniversary of the horrific terrorist attacks in Christchurch\\u201d. \\u201cNew Zealanders responded to hate with love in the aftermath of this terrible incident, and that powerful message endures today,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOur two nations share an ongoing commitment to peace and freedom and we continue to reject those who seek to spread division and hatred. \\u201cGlobally, whether it\\u2019s the Christchurch Call to Action or last year\\u2019s G20 and G7 resolutions to stamp out online hate and violence, New Zealand and Australia will continue our work to ensure something like this does not happen again.\\u201d In April Australia passed world-first legislation to crack down on violent videos on social media, to prevent a reoccurrence of the Christchurch attacker\\u2019s video spreading on social media faster than it could be removed. In February Guardian Australia revealed that one of Dutton\\u2019s staff members cited the climate activist group Extinction Rebellion as an example of a troublesome leftwing organisation during a telephone conversation with a member of the public who sought to query his claims leftwing groups also posed a risk.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 529}, {\"title\": \"Disney Estate Uncovers Cache Of Anti-American Cartoons Intended For Release If Axis Won WWII\", \"url\": \"https://entertainment.theonion.com/disney-estate-uncovers-cache-of-anti-american-cartoons-1833665457\", \"content\": \"In a shocking discovery certain to complicate the legacy of a national icon, the estate of Walt Disney announced Friday it had discovered a cache of anti-American cartoons the pioneering animator intended to release if the Axis Powers had triumphed in World War II.\", \"fake\": \"1\", \"title_len\": 14, \"content_len\": 44}, {\"title\": \"Health Experts Worry Coronavirus Will Overwhelm America\\u2019s GoFundMe System\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/health-experts-worry-coronavirus-will-overwhelm-america-1842314132\", \"content\": \"Warning that the nation was unprepared to deal with the fallout of the global pandemic, researchers from Johns Hopkins University told reporters Friday they worried that Covid-19 would overwhelm America\\u2019s GoFundMe system. \\u201cGoFundMe is the bedrock of the American healthcare system, and as the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rapidly spread, we fear the servers just won\\u2019t be able to take it,\\u201d said research director Dr. Monica White, who stressed that if the pandemic were to grow any worse, there simply would not be enough $5 and $10 donations from sympathetic strangers to go around. \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s GoFundMe system is already overburdened.

Thames Valley police said burglars had broken into the gallery on St Aldates, which is part of Oxford University\\u2019s Christ Church college, at around 11pm on Saturday. Nobody was injured during the heist, police confirmed. They took Salvator Rosa\\u2019s A Rocky Coast, With Soldiers Studying a Plan, from the late 1640s, Anthony Van Dyck\\u2019s A Soldier on Horseback, circa 1616, and Annibale Carracci\\u2019s A Boy Drinking, circa 1580. DCI Jon Capps appealed to the public for information. \\u201cThe paintings which have been stolen are very high-value pieces dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries,\\u201d Capps said. \\u201cThe artwork has not yet been recovered but a thorough investigation is under way to find it and bring those responsible to justice. There will be an increased police presence in the area while officers and staff carry out enquiries. If you saw or heard anything suspicious in the area last night, please get in touch.\\u201d Capps also urged members of the public to come forward and share any CCTV or other footage from around the area they might have and which they thought could help with the investigation. In 1765, general John Guise bequeathed his collection of more than 200 paintings and almost 2,000 drawings to his former college Christ Church. Thanks to the generous donation the college, founded in 1546, was able to introduce art into Oxford education without students needing to travel to Italy or visit stately homes, where at that time the majority of art collections in the UK were to be found. The loss of the paintings was a fresh blow to the college, which had already made headlines this weekend after it discovered that cases of burgundy and Pouilly-Fuiss\\u00e9 worth between \\u00a31,000 and \\u00a32,000 have been mysteriously disappearing from its large fine wine collection, as the Times newspaper reported on Saturday. The purpose-built gallery was designed by the architects Powell and Moya and was opened by the Queen in 1968.

In Florida, the impact of the virus, if left unchecked, could be particularly harsh on the state\\u2019s ability to allow people to vote or vote safely without fear of infection. The state is home to one of the largest elderly populations in the country, with around 20% of the residents age 65 or older. While this age group tends to be a stable voting bloc for both political parties, it\\u2019s also the most vulnerable to the virus \\u2013 which has a mortality rate around 18% for those over 80 years old. DeSantis issued an executive order barring people who may have been exposed to the virus from visiting nursing homes. He urged election officials throughout the state to consider moving their polling locations for the state\\u2019s 17 March primary out of those locations. But over the weekend before election day, the state seemed to be lacking a unified response, with many polling stations in senior centers and retirement communities still operating at status quo. Workers at Country Aire Manor, Senate Manor Estates, and Crystal Lakes Manor \\u2013 Pasco and Pinellas county polling sites all held in communities comprised entirely of people above 55 \\u2013 said they had received no guidelines for the election, and were already receiving equipment to set up for Tuesday. \\u201cAll locations will be open,\\u201d said Robin Lehoux, who works at the parks and recreation department in Pompano Beach, Florida. She hadn\\u2019t heard of any instructions from the state or local government regarding the Mullins Park Senior Center, a polling precinct where other senior programming had been shut down. But Florida\\u2019s piecemeal response has been a stark departure from other election officials across the country implementing last-minute measures to stave off concerns about contracting coronavirus at the polls. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered all polling stations in senior centers and nursing homes to be relocated. Louisiana\\u2019s state\\u2019s top election official, Kyle Ardoin, announced Friday the primary election next month would be postponed until June. \\u201cThey\\u2019re playing catch up,\\u201d said congressman Darren Soto, who represents a central Florida district that includes Orlando. Soto was still expecting a large voter turnout on Friday, and said he was focused on making sure voting precincts remained open so crowds were dispersed. \\u201cThe main thing is to avoid long lines so people can conduct best practices.\\u201d Some election officials are still taking full precautions. In Broward county, the local supervisor of elections announced this week the county was moving 12 precincts from senior centers and assisted living facilities to alternate locations. The county sent out postcards to all of the voters who would normally cast ballots there letting them know their locations had moved. Some senior living facilities don\\u2019t want to move their polling locations because they are wary of having to transport residents, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for the Broward county elections office. In such cases, the county elections office will make sure they have adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies, Vancore said. \\ufeff State officials held a conference call with local supervisors of elections on Thursday to discuss sanitary measures they could take at the polls. In Volusia county, the supervisor of elections reminded voters they could bring their own pens to fill out ballots. In Marion county, elections officials have limited cleaning supplies and are encouraging people to bring their own from home, said Wesley Wilcox, the county\\u2019s supervisor of elections. Florida is no stranger to adapting elections to emergencies. In 2018, Hurricane Michael derailed precincts in the panhandle, and forced election officials to extend voting hours and move locations. In 2016, a federal judge extended voter registration because of disruptions caused by Hurricane Matthew, despite opposition from Republican governor Rick Scott. But the state often only acts at the last minute. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fight every time,\\u201d said Brad Ashwell, the Florida director of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. The organization was looking to support changes for the primary that could include an extension in vote-by-mail deadlines, poll worker recruitment, as elderly poll workers dropped out, and more state funds to advertise changes to the polling stations. \\u201cIt seems like the freak out level is slowly creeping in here,\\u201d Ashwell said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t sense anxiety among people. People are upset their conferences are being cancelled. But it doesn\\u2019t seem like there\\u2019s a real high levels of concern.\\u201d Meanwhile, he said, the fears around Covid-19 could build on other issues that voters faced in the state. Under the pressure of lawsuit brought on by civil rights groups and Puerto Rican residents, the state has been attempting to provide bilingual language assistance at each station, which could be impacted if poll workers don\\u2019t show up on Tuesday. And the state rejected tens of thousands of mail-in ballots and absentee ballots in recent elections, stoking mistrust in that system. Danny Turkel, spokesperson for Voto Latino, an advocacy group focused on registering Latinx voters, said he predicted lower voter turnout in the election because of the state of emergency. He didn\\u2019t think any specific community would be impacted, he said, but predicted that the uncertainty would keep voters at home. \\u201cBeing from Miami, I\\u2019m acutely aware of the difficulties people have,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere were already obstacles in the way that the state has done nothing to improve.\\u201d \\u201cI think it will show out in the numbers.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 939}, {\"title\": \"911 Operator Informs Black Caller That Death Is On The Way\", \"url\": \"https://local.theonion.com/911-operator-informs-black-caller-that-death-is-on-the-1839063288\", \"content\": \"Reassuring the man that he would receive an immediate response to his emergency, a 911 operator reportedly informed local black caller Jerry Wardell Tuesday that death was on the way. \\u201cThank you for calling 911, please sit tight and don\\u2019t worry, first responders will be there to end your life shortly,\\u201d said the 911 operator after confirming what Wardell looked like, as well as the identities of others present at the emergency situation, in order to arrange for sufficient agents of death to ensure the expiration of every black life present. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve already dispatched several liquidators into the field, so just remain calm and you should be dead within 10 minutes.

Chefs like Greene are flocking back, their pockets stuffed with experience, their heads full of new ideas. In Greene\\u2019s case, elsewhere was Noma in Copenhagen, where chef Ren\\u00e9 Redzepi pursues a devoutly regionalist agenda: it\\u2019s vinegar instead of lemon juice, butter rather than olive oil, because it\\u2019s a northern European restaurant not a southern Mediterranean one. Some people, those who like ideology more than lunch, got the wrong end of the Norway spruce stick over all this. They saw Noma as somehow defining the correct agenda for all restaurants. In a globalised world, that\\u2019s absurd. We can find such notions interesting in Dublin or Copenhagen, while still craving the flavours of Provence or Malaysia and being grateful they are available nearby. In truth, the agenda is utterly pointless unless, like Redzepi, you\\u2019re also an exceptionally gifted chef. The same applies to Greene. The man is bursting with good taste and technique. Bastible was opened four years ago in Portobello to the south of Dublin\\u2019s city centre by Barry Fitzgerald and Claire-Marie Thomas. Greene arrived last spring and is now throwing everything on to the table. Usually, the prospect of a tasting menu makes my left eye twitch, but here on a Sunday lunchtime it becomes a joyful dance. Those of us who arrive early \\u2013 lunch trails on until darkness falls \\u2013 get to watch those a few courses behind, jealously, knowing the joys they have to come. It starts, as ever, with an addictive, hard-crusted sourdough, with a crunch like crackling, and whorls of whipped, salty cultured butter that demand to be finished. That\\u2019s followed by a cube of thinly sliced and then compressed ox tongue. It arrives pierced on the still-smoking twig on which it was grilled. It has been cured with juniper. It is seasoned with dried, powdered mushrooms and the seaside briskness of dried kelp. It has the soft meatiness of the very best pastrami. Next, there\\u2019s a rough-chopped tartare of Dexter beef under the forest floor earthiness of an artichoke cream, thickly dusted with more dried, powdered ceps and layered with a few green leaves. It\\u2019s a rugged dish in all ways. Against it, the kohlrabi acts as a palate cleanser and sets us up for the arrival of sweet and sticky Connemara prawns served raw, with thin slices of broccoli stem and leaves of marigold perched on top of each piece so that, arranged in a curve, they look like a Roman senator\\u2019s garland. It sits in a pool of a deep green broth made with the juices from the kohlrabi, fig leaf oil and the punch of horseradish. These are the ingredients that are available now, shown as good a time as possible. As is the next dish. It\\u2019s a \\u201ccelebration of the humble swede\\u201d as Greene puts it. (There are waiters working the simple square box of a dining room, but he does serve some of the dishes himself straight from the open kitchen to the tables.) The semi-circular discs of swede have been cooked slowly in ginger oil to a gentle piquancy. Alongside, is what he calls a pumpkin seed mole, a deep savoury sauce glowing with jewel-like dots of more oil. Tiny square pieces of slightly jellied kelp form a pattern across the swede along with hyper savoury pumpkin seeds roasted in yeast. Gosh. And, oh. I ask Greene about the ginger, which seems to break the regional frame. He agrees it does, but says he\\u2019s not doctrinaire. For the most part, though, lunch comes from hereabouts and right now. We are presented with a slab of cured sea trout to share. It\\u2019s a deep, appealing shade of dirty orange. It\\u2019s been brushed repeatedly with a quince glaze and is warm so that the oils are just running. We are told to treat it like smoked salmon; to pull it away from the skin below. There\\u2019s a farl of bread made with new potatoes, its undulating surface rendered dark and sticky courtesy of a cider-vinegar glaze. To mitigate the sweetness of the fish, we have a boisterously sour gooseberry compote, plus a bowl of yogurt dusted with powdered dried herbs. How you put these together is up to you. It has become the best kind of buffet. To finish we have a sweetened and set sheep\\u2019s milk yogurt with a sauce of fermented plum. Better still, is an intense milk chocolate mousse hiding a scoop of yeast ice-cream, sprinkled with dried plum skins and blackcurrant, in a sweet, nutty syrup made from beer. Oh, and would you like a chewy caramel wrapped in blackcurrant leather and dusted with salt? Yes please. This has been my most detailed account of the food I was served in a long while, but Bastible warrants it. Even so I know I have left out details. It\\u2019s that kind of place. Given this menu is just \\u20ac45 (\\u00a339), I would argue it warrants a weekend in Dublin. Just be aware that, courtesy of some the most savage duties in Europe, the wine list is a nightmare, with nothing below \\u20ac36 (\\u00a331). Don\\u2019t worry. C\\u00fa\\u00e1n Greene\\u2019s cooking will make you thrillingly giddy and euphoric all by itself. News bites The night before my lunch at Bastible in Dublin, I ate at Hadskis, a favourite haunt when I\\u2019m in Belfast. The menu at chef Niall McKenna\\u2019s clamorous urban brasserie, sister restaurant to James St, boasts some great non-meat cookery. But inevitably the action lies with the steaks, sourced from Hannan Meats because it\\u2019s the law in these parts. A 1.2kg sharing tomahawk for \\u00a368, including two sides, comes seared and pink in all the right places and leaves a serving dish full of juices perfectly designed for mopping. I\\u2019ve reported a lot of closures in this column recently, so let\\u2019s have some cheer from\\u2026 Greggs. The high street bakery company has reported an exceptional year to the end of 2019. Another 138 shops have opened, sales are up 13.5% to over \\u00a31.1 billion and pre-tax profits have surged by 27.2% to \\u00a3114 million. Vegan sausage rolls all round.

It will take more than shaking the money tree to correct it | David Olusoga\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\", \"content\": \"Inevitably, the big story to come out of last week\\u2019s budget were the measures to tackle the pandemic. But if we were living in anything even vaguely resembling normal times, things would have been different. Just weeks ago, Boris Johnson\\u2019s government presumed that the most eye-catching, headline-grabbing, media-friendly budget announcement would be the pledge to triple investment in roads, railways, research and broadband, with some money also for housing. Over the five years of this parliament, more than \\u00a3600bn is to be invested, with around \\u00a3120bn being spent each year. When it comes to infrastructure spending \\u2013 though to not much else \\u2013 the age of austerity is well and truly over and the once elusive magic money tree has finally been located. Despite having been in the post for just a few weeks, and despite delivering his first budget in the midst of the most serious public health crisis for a century, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, set out to address one of the most intractable issues that has confronted every recent administration: Britain\\u2019s ageing, creaking and, in some cases, literally Victorian infrastructure. But the government\\u2019s ambitions are even grander. This, Sunak claimed, was \\u201ca budget for people right across the country\\u201d in which \\u201cno region will be left behind\\u201d. \\u201cBy investing historic amounts in British innovation and world-class infrastructure,\\u201d he told parliament, \\u201cwe will rebalance opportunities and lay the foundations for a decade of growth for everybody.\\u201d We were further informed by the chancellor that this was the \\u201clevelling up\\u201d budget. What he promised was not just gleaming new railways and roads, but, more, that the process of constructing them and the benefits that would arrive once they were in place would be shared by the whole country. But if we as a nation really want to see the inequalities between the regions reduced, we need to level with ourselves about the scale of the disparity between the wealthy south and the \\u201cleft behind\\u201d towns, in the north and elsewhere. We also need to ask to what extent increases in infrastructure alone, important though it undoubtedly is, address the problem. Not only does the UK have the highest levels of regional inequality among the major economies, the imbalance is widening, not narrowing. The accountancy firm EY has forecast that, unless such imbalances are tackled, the north will continue to fall behind the south until 2023. And this is not just a north-south divide issue. The small towns of the disadvantaged regions are faring particularly badly and are likely to see far lower levels of growth than the bigger northern cities. Beyond north v south and big cities v small towns, there is the urban elephant in the room \\u2013 the sheer scale of London and the privileged position it and the south-east has long enjoyed when it comes to capital investment and infrastructure spending. While everyone knows that London is both big and overprivileged when it comes to spending, the scale of its dominance is poorly understood. London is not just the biggest city in the UK, it is the biggest city in western Europe. It is also the richest region. London\\u2019s population is around 160% the size of the next 10 British cities combined and, historically speaking, that figure is comparatively low. In the 1750s, London was 282% the size of her next 10 rivals. There are now several boroughs in the capital with populations of more a third of a million. Croydon has a bigger population than Leicester, Newham more than Sunderland and Lambeth is more populous than Aberdeen. But London bias is not just a consequence of its size; it is baked into the political system. The guidelines that influence decisions on which infrastructure investments are deemed value for money, the so-called \\u201cgreen book\\u201d rules, favour the capital and the south-east, where returns will be highest. The effects of such formula amount, at times, to a national disgrace. As Dan Jackson points out in his brilliant book The Northumbrians, transport infrastructure spending for London in 2014 stood at around \\u00a32,500 per head, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research. The corresponding figure for the north-east of England was just \\u00a35 per head. Little wonder that region is where some of the highest levels of antipathy towards the capital are to be found. So \\u00a3600bn is a lot of money, but not that much when set against decades of under-investment and centuries of London bias. Over the past half century there have been around 40 initiatives that have attempted to narrow the economic and infrastructural inequalities between the UK regions. Most were short-term and few have had any significant effect. It will take more than this increase in infrastructure spending, or the government\\u2019s commitment to HS2, to shift the dial. If levelling up is to be more than an election slogan, the government\\u2019s infrastructure strategy, published later this year, will need to be more revolutionary. As Lord Kerslake, chair of the UK2070 Commission, warned last month, if government can\\u2019t \\u201cgo big, it should go home\\u201d.

But I come from a different place now. I had a lot to prove. And I did it. I\\u2019m not angry now. The opposite.\\u201d Tamimi worked in West Jerusalem and Tel Aviv before moving to London in 1997 where he was head chef at the deli Baker &amp; Spice. Here he met Yotam Ottolenghi, an Israeli who also grew up in Jerusalem. Ottolenghi left in 2001 to start his own place, and Tamimi joined not long after; they have been business partners ever since. It was while they were putting together recipes for their 2012 bestseller Jerusalem that Tamimi began to appreciate how his Palestinian roots influenced his food. But he remained estranged from his family. \\u201cI lost contact for almost 17 years,\\u201d he says, with a wistful shake of his head. \\u201cTime flies when you\\u2019re chopping an onion,\\u201d adds Tara Wigley, one of the \\u201cOttolenghi family\\u201d for a decade, who shares the writing with Tamimi on a new cookbook, Falastin.

In Gaza, it is dominated by fish and spices; in the West Bank, it is meats, flatbread and fermented yogurt. Tahini, za\\u2019atar and shatta, a condiment made from red or green chillies, are ubiquitous. \\u201cPeople are ready to zoom in, rather than just call it Middle Eastern food,\\u201d says Wigley, who worked alongside Ottolenghi on Plenty More and Simple. \\u201cNo one needs to know from us how to make tabbouleh traditionally, so we\\u2019ve got three new tabboulehs. But we also have chicken musakhan, sumac onions and the \\u201cupside down\\u201d maqluba dish.\\u201d \\u201cPalestinian food is very earthy, it\\u2019s not pretty to look at,\\u201d Tamimi chips in. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of beige and brown.

If you do want to make it in advance, though, that\\u2019s fine: just store it in an airtight container and keep it in the fridge for up to 4 days. If the hummus develops a bit of a skin then just give it a stir before serving. The most important thing if storing in the fridge, is to bring it back to room temperature before serving, to warm and loosen up. The meatballs can be made, rolled and kept in the fridge for a day before serving, all ready to fry. If doing this, store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days, but don\\u2019t pack them too tightly: you want them to keep their round shape. They also freeze well, for up to a month. If you fry them from frozen they will need a couple more minutes in the oven to warm through. Serves 6 For the hummus dried chickpeas 250g, soaked overnight in double their volume of water bicarbonate of soda 1 tsp tahini 270g lemon juice 60ml garlic 4 cloves, crushed salt ice-cold water 100ml For kofta hummus beef or veal mince (or a mixture of both) 500g onion 1 small, peeled and coarsely grated tomato 1 large, coarsely grated and skin discarded (65g) parsley 20g, finely chopped red chilli 1, deseeded and finely chopped olive oil about 45ml, to fry salt and black pepper For the kofta hummus topping olive oil 1 tbsp pine nuts 25g parsley 5g, roughly chopped Aleppo chilli flakes \\u00bd tsp (or \\u00bc tsp regular chilli flakes) mint leaves a few (optional) For aubergine hummus aubergines 2 large, cut into roughly 2cm cubes (500g) sunflower oil about 300ml, to fry walnut halves 160g, roughly chopped parsley leaves 10g, roughly chopped mint leaves 10g, roughly chopped lemon juice 2 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp Aleppo chilli flakes \\u00bd tsp To make the hummus, drain the chickpeas and place them in a medium saucepan on a high heat. Add the bicarbonate of soda and cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1\\u00bd litres of water and bring to the boil. Cook for about 30 minutes \\u2013 timing can vary from 20 to 40 minutes depending on the freshness of the chickpeas \\u2013 skimming off any foam that appears. The chickpeas are ready when they collapse easily when pressed between thumb and finger: almost but not quite mushy. Drain the chickpeas and transfer them to a food processor. Process to form a stiff paste and then, with the machine still running, add the tahini, lemon juice, garlic and 1\\u00bd teaspoons of salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and continue to process for another 5 minutes: this will feel like a long time but it is what is needed to get a very smooth and creamy paste. Transfer to a bowl and set aside at room temperature, until needed. If you are making it in advance then transfer to a sealed container and keep in the fridge. Remove it half an hour before serving, to bring it back to room temperature, and give it a good stir if a \\u201cskin\\u201d has formed. To make the kofta hummus: Place all the ingredients for the meatballs, apart from the olive oil, in a medium bowl with 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Using your hands, mix well to combine. With wet hands, roll the mixture into roughly 3cm balls (weighing about 15g each): you should make about 45 balls. To make the topping, put the tablespoon of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium heat. Add the pine nuts and cook for a minute, stirring constantly, until they are golden brown. Spoon the nuts, along with the oil from the pan, into a little bowl and set aside. Add a tablespoon of the oil for frying the kofta to the same pan and place on a medium heat. Add a third of the meatballs \\u2013 or as many as you can fit into the pan without overcrowding \\u2013 and cook for about 3 minutes, turning throughout so that all sides take on colour and the balls are just cooked through. Keep them somewhere warm while you continue with the remaining balls, adding another tablespoon of oil with each batch. When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual shallow bowls, creating a slight hollow in the centre of each. Divide the meatballs between the bowls, placing them in the middle of the hummus, and spoon over the pine nuts and their cooking oil. Sprinkle over the parsley, chilli and mint, if using, and serve with a final drizzle of olive oil. To make the aubergine hummus: Place the aubergines in a colander placed over a bowl or in the sink and sprinkle over 1 teaspoon of salt. Use your hands to mix well, then set aside for about 45 minutes: this is so that the bitter juices can be released. Transfer the aubergines to a tray lined with kitchen paper and pat dry as best you can. Put the sunflower oil into a medium frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the aubergines \\u2013 in two or three batches so as to not overcrowd the pan \\u2013 and fry for about 8 minutes, until completely softened and golden brown. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the aubergines to another tray lined with kitchen paper (or the same tray lined with fresh kitchen paper) and set aside, for the excess oil to be absorbed, while you continue with the remaining batches. Transfer the aubergines to a bowl, add the walnuts, parsley, mint, lemon, olive oil and Aleppo chilli and mix well to combine. When ready to serve, spoon the hummus into individual serving bowls, creating a small well in the middle of each portion. Spoon in the aubergine and serve at once. Serve the hummus with warm pita for scooping, along with a chopped salad to lighten things up. Shatta (red or green) This fiery condiment is as easy to make as it is to become addicted to. Shatta is there on every Palestinian table, cutting through rich foods or pepping up others. Eggs, fish, meat, vegetables: they all love it. Our recommendation is to keep a jar in your fridge or cupboard at all times. Once made, shatta will keep in the fridge for up to 6 months. The oil will firm up and separate from the chillies once it\\u2019s in the fridge, so just give it a good stir, for everything to combine, before using. As with anything being left to ferment, the jar you put your chillies into needs to be properly sterilised. There are various ways to do this. A water bath (where the jars go into the water, with their lids added separately, the water is brought to the boil and then the jars are \\u201ccooked\\u201d for 10 minutes), or filing them with just-boiled water and then rinsing and drying them with a clean tea-towel. We tend to just put them into the dishwasher and run it as a normal wash: it works very well. Makes 1 medium jar red or green chillies 250g, stems trimmed and then very thinly sliced (with seeds) salt 1 tbsp cider vinegar 3 tbsp lemon juice 1 tbsp olive oil to cover and seal Place the chillies and salt in a medium sterilised jar and mix well. Seal the jar and store in the fridge for 3 days. On the third day, drain the chillies, transfer them to a food processor and blitz: you can either blitz well to form a fine paste or roughly blitz so that some texture remains. Add the vinegar and lemon juice, mix to combine, then return the mixture to the same jar. Pour enough olive oil on top to seal, and keep in the fridge. Baby gem lettuce with burnt aubergine yogurt, smacked cucumber &amp; shatta This works well either as a stand-alone starter or as part of a spread or side. It\\u2019s lovely with some hot smoked salmon or trout. Thanks to Ottolenghi chef Calvin Von Niebel for this salad. The shatta needs to be made in advance. Some crumbled feta on top works very well, and if you don\\u2019t have the urfa chilli flakes, just use a pinch of black nigella seeds or some black sesame seeds. Serves 4 generously baby gem lettuces 5-6 (500g), bases trimmed salt and black pepper red or green shatta 1\\u00bd tbsp (see recipe above), or rose harissa, as an alternative urfa chilli flakes \\u00bd tsp (or a small pinch of nigella seeds or black sesame seeds) For the aubergine yogurt aubergines 2 large (500g) Greek-style yogurt 35g garlic \\u00bd clove, roughly chopped lemon juice 1\\u00bd tbsp tahini 1\\u00bd tbsp (25g) For the smacked cucumber cucumber 1 regular English (ie not a small Lebanese), peeled, sliced in half lengthways and watery seeds removed (180g) parsley 25g, roughly chopped mint leaves 25g, roughly chopped garlic \\u00bd clove, roughly chopped olive oil 50ml The more you char your aubergines, the smokier the flesh. Unless you don\\u2019t mind your whole house smelling of aubergines, ventilation is key. We char our aubergines in one of two ways. The first, if you have a gas cooker, is to put one aubergine over each gas ring, switch the flame on high and leave it there for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway with long tongs so that all sides get charred. Any mess can be minimised if in the first place if you cover your stove top with tin foil. Make holes in the foil for the gas rings to pop through, then proceed. If you have an induction hob, heat up a chargrill pan until very hot \\u2013 sit it on a high heat for at least 5 minutes, until it is smoking. Pierce the aubergines a few times with a sharp knife then add them to the pan. This method takes longer than the open flame \\u2013 around 35-40 minutes, again turning throughout with tongs so that all sides get charred \\u2013 but will get the same result. At the end of the 40 minutes, transfer the aubergine to a foil-lined tray and place under a hot grill for 10 minutes. Once charred, place the aubergines in a colander. When cool enough to handle, slit them open to scoop out the flesh and place in a clean colander. Set aside for an hour or so (or overnight) over a bowl to drain. The scooped-out flesh should weigh about 160g. Place this in the bowl of a food processor along with the yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, tahini and \\u00bd a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about a minute, until completely smooth, then set aside until needed. Prepare the cucumber by placing each half on a chopping board, cut side facing down. Using the flat side of a large knife, lightly smack them until bruised but still holding their shape. Cut the cucumber into roughly 1cm dice and set aside in a dish. Clean the food processor, then add the parsley, mint, garlic, olive oil and \\u00bc a teaspoon of salt. Blitz for about 2 minutes, scraping down the sides a couple of times if you need to, to form a smooth paste, then add to the cucumber. Set aside for at least 20 minutes (and up to a day in advance if kept in the fridge) for the flavours to infuse. Slice each head of baby gem lengthways to make 8 long thin wedges (per lettuce). When ready to assemble, arrange the lettuce on a round platter, overlapping the outer and inner circle to look like the petals of a flower. Lightly sprinkle the wedges with salt and a grind of black pepper, then splatter over the aubergine yogurt. Spoon over the cucumber, drizzle with the shatta, sprinkle over the chilli flakes and serve. Prawn &amp; tomato stew with coriander pesto Serve this as it is, with some crusty white bread to mop up the juices, or dot some cubes of white feta or black olives (or both) on top. A crisp green salad with a lemony dressing on the side and you\\u2019re all set. Batch-make the base for the stew here, if you like: this freezes well and keeps in the fridge for a good few days. That way you can just char your cherry tomatoes and pan-fry the prawns in minutes. The coriander pesto can also be made up to 3 days in advance and kept in the fridge. Serves 4 cherry tomatoes 250g olive oil 60ml onion 1 large, finely chopped (180g) garlic 4 cloves, crushed ginger 2cm piece, peeled and finely grated (15g) green chilli 1, finely chopped coriander seeds 2 tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar cumin seeds 1\\u00bd tsp, lightly crushed in a pestle and mortar cardamom pods 8, lightly bashed in a pestle and mortar dill 20g, finely chopped tomato puree 2 tsp plum tomatoes 6, roughly chopped (500g) salt and black pepper raw king prawns 600g, peeled For the coriander pesto coriander 30g, roughly chopped green chilli 1, finely chopped pine nuts 50g, lightly toasted lemon 1, finely grate the zest to get 1\\u00bd tsp, then cut into wedges, to serve olive oil 80ml Place a large saut\\u00e9 pan on a high heat. Toss the cherry tomatoes with 1 teaspoon of oil and, once the pan is very hot, add the tomatoes. Cook for about 5 minutes, shaking the pan once or twice, until blistered and heavily charred on all sides. Remove the tomatoes from the pan and set them aside. Wipe the pan clean, add 2 tablespoons of oil and replace it on the stove on a medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned. Add the garlic, ginger, chilli, spices, dill and tomato puree and cook for another 2 minutes, until fragrant. Add the plum tomatoes, 300ml of water, 1\\u00bd teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to medium and cook for about 25 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened and the tomatoes have completely broken down. While the sauce is cooking, make the coriander pesto. Put the coriander, chilli and pine nuts into a food processor and pulse a few times until the pine nuts are roughly crumbled. Transfer to a bowl and add the lemon zest, oil, \\u00bc teaspoon of salt and a grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then set aside. Pat the prawns dry and mix them in a bowl with \\u00bc teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of oil and a good grind of black pepper. Put 2 teaspoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a high heat. Once hot, add the prawns in batches and fry for a minute on each side, until cooked through and nicely browned. Set each batch aside while you continue with the remaining prawns. When the sauce is ready, stir in the prawns and charred tomatoes and cook on a medium heat for about another 3 minutes, to heat through. Serve either straight from the pan or spoon into wide shallow bowls. Scoop out the cardamom pods before serving, if you like: they are there to flavour the dish rather than to be eaten. Dot with about half of the pesto and serve at once, with the lemon and remaining pesto in a bowl alongside. Fish kofta with yogurt, sumac &amp; chilli These herb- and spice-packed kofta make a lovely starter, or a light meal in themselves, packed into a pita and served with a chopped salad. These can be made in advance \\u2013 up to a day, if you like \\u2013 up to the point where they are about to go into the oven. Once cooked they can be eaten the next day \\u2013 the flavours actually improve \\u2013 either at room temperature or warmed through. Serves 4 olive oil 90ml onions 2 large, finely chopped garlic 6 cloves, crushed cod fillet or loin 700g, skinless and boneless, chopped into 3cm chunks red chillies 2, one finely chopped and one finely sliced, to serve parsley leaves 15g, roughly chopped dill 15g, roughly chopped, plus a few extra picked leaves to serve lemon 1, finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into 4 wedges egg 1 fish spice mix 2 tsp (see below) sumac 1 tbsp Greek-style yogurt 200g salt and black pepper For the fish spice mix ground cardamom 2 tsp ground cumin 2 tsp paprika 1 tsp ground turmeric 2 tsp Preheat the oven to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Put 3 tablespoons of the oil into a large saut\\u00e9 pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onions and cook for 12-14 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until softened and golden. Add the garlic and cook for another 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside until completely cool. Put the fish into a food processor and pulse a few times until finely chopped but not a complete paste. Transfer to a large bowl and add the cooled onion mixture, chopped chilli, herbs, lemon zest, egg, fish spice mix, 2 teaspoons of sumac, 1 teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Mix well to combine, then, using your hands, shape the mixture into about 15 kofta: they should each be about 5cm wide and weigh about 65g. Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large frying pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the kofta in batches of 2 or 3 and fry for about 4 minutes, turning halfway through so that both sides are golden brown. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and bake for 4 or 5 minutes, until just cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes or so, to slightly cool. To serve, spread the yogurt evenly between four serving plates and top each with 3 fish kofta, saving any extra for seconds. Sprinkle the kofta with the remaining teaspoon of sumac, the picked dill and sliced chilli. Drizzle over the last tablespoon of oil and serve, with a lemon wedge alongside. The Observer aims to publish recipes for fish rated as sustainable by the Marine Conservation Society\\u2019s Good Fish Guide Chicken shawarma pie This is a wow of a pie. Serve it with a crisp green salad and some pickles. The chicken can be made a day or two ahead of assembling the pie. Keep it in the fridge and just bring it back to room temperature before putting the dish together. You can also just make the chicken part of the dish. It makes a delicious stew, served with steamed rice or piled into a pita or wrap. If you do this, keep the tahini sauce: it\\u2019s always a welcome addition. Serves 6 chicken thighs 750g, boneless and skinless garlic 4 cloves, crushed ginger 2cm piece, peeled and finely grated (15g) ground cumin 2 tsp ground coriander 2 tsp smoked paprika \\u00be tsp ground turmeric \\u00bd tsp ground cinnamon \\u00be tsp ground cloves \\u215b tsp olive oil 90ml, plus extra for greasing cider vinegar 3 tbsp salt and black pepper baking potatoes 2 (450g), unpeeled and cut into \\u00bdcm thick rounds unsalted butter 45g onion 1, thinly sliced (150g) chicken stock 200ml parsley leaves 5g, roughly chopped coriander leaves 5g, roughly chopped filo 8 sheets (30cm x 38cm) nigella seeds 1 tsp Aleppo chilli flakes \\u00be tsp (or \\u2153 tsp regular chilli flakes) For the tahini sauce tahini 50g Greek yogurt 80g garlic 2 cloves, crushed lemon juice 1 tbsp salt and black pepper Put the chicken into a large bowl with the garlic, ginger, ground spices, 1 tablespoon of oil, 2 tablespoons of vinegar, 1 teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper. Mix to combine, then leave to marinate for at least half an hour (or overnight in the fridge). Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Mix the potatoes with 1\\u00bd tablespoons of oil, \\u00be teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and spread out so that they are not overlapping. Bake for 20 minutes, then increase the oven temperature to 220C fan/gas mark 9. Remove the tray from the oven, carefully flip over each potato slice, then return to the oven for another 10 minutes, or until golden. Remove from the oven and set aside until needed. Reduce the oven temperature to 180C fan/gas mark 6 again (or turn the oven off for now and preheat before baking). Put 15g of butter and 1\\u00bd tablespoons of oil into a large saut\\u00e9 pan and place on a medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the chicken and cook for about 10 minutes, until lightly brown, then add the stock, \\u00bc teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to medium. Simmer gently for 25 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked through. Increase the heat to medium-high and continue to cook for about 8 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened and reduced to about 4 tablespoons. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for about 10 minutes, then use two forks to shred the chicken into large chunks. Stir in the herbs and set aside. To make the tahini sauce, put the tahini, yogurt, garlic, lemon juice, \\u215b teaspoon of salt and 2 tablespoons of water into a bowl. Whisk together until smooth, then set aside. Melt the remaining 30g of butter and combine with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil. Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin with baking parchment and lightly grease the sides with the butter mixture. Lay a sheet of filo out on a clean work surface and brush with the butter. Transfer this to the tin so that the base is covered and the filo rises up and over the tin\\u2019s sides. Repeat with the next sheet of filo, brushing it first with butter, then arranging it in the tin, rotating it slightly so that the excess hangs at a different angle. Continue in this fashion, brushing each piece generously as you go, until you have used up 6 pieces of filo in total and the base and sides are all covered. Next, add the potato slices, overlapping slightly, so that the base of the pie is completely covered. Top with the chicken mixture and gently push down to even out. Lastly, spoon over the tahini sauce, spreading it gently to coat the chicken layer. Brush a piece of filo with butter and fold it in half horizontally,like a book. Place this over the tahini layer, tucking in the filo around the filling. Brush the top with the butter mixture, then repeat with the last piece of filo, angling it to cover any exposed areas. Now fold over the overhang, crinkling up the filo to create a nice crumpled effect on the top. Brush the top with the remaining butter, sprinkle with the nigella seeds, place on a tray and bake Filo triangles with cream cheese, pistachio &amp; rose \\u2013 warbat Warbat is a popular snack during the month of Ramadan. The filling is traditionally made with ishta \\u2013 a kind of thick, silky cream \\u2013 which is then drizzled with rose water or rose water syrup. Ishta is not always easy to find, so we\\u2019ve created a cream cheese filling instead. Makes 12 pastries filo pastry 10 sheets, each sheet 31cm x 38cm unsalted butter 120g, melted For the syrup caster sugar 100g lemon juice 1\\u00bd tsp rose water \\u00be tsp For the filling full-fat cream cheese 450g cornflour 2 tsp caster sugar 55g flaked sea salt \\u00bd tsp powdered Arabic mastic gum \\u00bc tsp, or \\u00bd tsp vanilla bean paste To garnish pistachio kernels 20g, finely crushed in a food processor, or by hand as finely as possible dried rose petals about 1\\u00bd tbsp (optional) First make the syrup. Put 55ml of water and the sugar into a small saucepan and place on a medium-high heat. Mix well using a wooden spoon, then, once it starts boiling, add the lemon juice. Simmer gently for 2 minutes, then stir in the rose water and remove from the heat straightaway. Set aside. Preheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. To make the filling, put the cream cheese, cornflour, sugar, salt and mastic (or vanilla bean paste) into a medium bowl and whisk well to combine. To assemble, spread one filo sheet out on a work surface and brush evenly with some of the melted butter. Top with another sheet and brush with butter again. Repeat the process until you have 5 layers evenly brushed with butter. As is always the case when working with filo, you\\u2019ll need to work fast when you start brushing and folding: the pastry will dry out if you don\\u2019t. You should have used about a quarter of the melted butter at this stage. Using sharp scissors, cut the layered sheet of pastry into 6 squares, all 12cm x 12cm \\u2013 you\\u2019ll need to trim the sheets to get even squares. Taking one square at a time, spoon about 35g (or 2 tablespoons) of the thick filling into the centre of each square, leaving a 2-3cm border around the edge. Fold the pastry diagonally in half to form a triangle, press on the edges without reaching the filling (so that it stays well sealed within the pastry), then brush all over with more butter. Once all 6 triangle pastries are on a parchment-lined baking tray, repeat the whole process (brushing one large filo sheet with butter, layering it 5 times, cutting it into 6 squares, filling and folding and sealing each square) with the remaining pastry, butter and filling. Once all 12 pastries are made up and spread on two parchment-lined baking trays, bake for 22 minutes or until golden and crisp: some of them will pop open, but that\\u2019s OK. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Drizzle over the syrup, sprinkle over the crushed pistachios and rose petals, if using, and serve.

Orders for cottage pies, pasta bakes and fish-finger sandwiches have been placed and are being processed in the kitchen next door. Meanwhile, six very hungry children are expending as much energy as possible \\u2013 swinging from door handles, batting balloons in all directions \\u2013 as they wait for the food to arrive. At a long table decked with flowers and colouring books, their parents are doing their best, amid screams and laughter, to conduct an intelligible conversation. The topic is takeaway food: its conveniences, its letdowns, and the increasing sway that online delivery companies such as Just Eat and Deliveroo are exerting over our family mealtimes. Serena Cunningham, who lives in Lambeth, is a regular takeaway consumer \\u2013 she orders a delivery via Uber Eats about once a week, when the demands on her time make it impossible to cook at home. \\u201cI\\u2019m a single mum, I\\u2019ve got four kids, and life is very hectic with work, doing the school runs daily and bringing the children to their activities, and still having to prepare a meal\\u2026 it\\u2019s a lot,\\u201d she says. Ordering takeaway is by no means a perfect solution. \\u201cSomething goes missing, something\\u2019s cold, something doesn\\u2019t taste right, you find a piece of hair \\u2013 and home-cooked food to me always tastes better,\\u201d she says. \\u201cFor some reason I\\u2019m still ordering. They make it so easy.\\u201d Among the considerations Serena weighs up while scrolling through takeaway menus on her phone \\u2013 such as whether to let her younger children Noah-Isaac, nine, and Naila, four, indulge their ardent love of melted cheese \\u2013 healthy eating isn\\u2019t necessarily top of the list. \\u201cYou can get healthy food,\\u201d she says. \\u201cFor example, McDonald\\u2019s let you choose carrots or chips, so we do have a choice. But, we end up going for the chips \\u2013 my children prefer them.\\u201d We\\u2019re here to taste-test a new takeaway which claims to offer healthier options across the board. Medleys, which launched last November from the commercial kitchen next door, is a delivery-only service available via Just Eat and other platforms, and its menu looks nothing out of the ordinary. Bright-red, with a jaunty logo and stickers promising discounts on orders over a tenner, it advertises dishes \\u2013 peri-peri chicken and lasagne \\u2013 that you\\u2019ll find in takeaways all over the capital. Take a closer look and you\\u2019ll notice the emphasis is on homely classics, many with veg or salad. And the prices are competitive: cottage pie with greens costs \\u00a35.99, while veggie curry is under a fiver. Amid the parade of fried temptations that saturate the lower end of the takeaway market, this seems like a point of difference. To understand what\\u2019s truly different about Medleys, you have to look further afield, because neither the menu nor its online profile gives any indication that this fledgling enterprise, with its core staff of two and its modest cooking set-up, is part of an ambitious initiative to tackle childhood obesity in the UK. The organisation behind it is Shift, a London-based design charity that builds social ventures as well as physical products. They\\u2019ve been working on food-related projects since 2012 \\u2013 one, in east London, attempted to create a healthier alternative to high-street chicken shops. With this challenge they really do, as project leader Patrick Bek admits, \\u201chave a mountain to climb\\u201d. A complex problem with many interlinking causes, childhood obesity is on the rise. According to the NHS, 20.1% children aged 10-11 in England now qualify as obese, up from 17.5% in 2006. The prevalence more than doubles in the most deprived areas, compared to the least deprived, and in Camberwell Green, just up the road from the Medleys kitchen, obesity rates are among the highest in the country, rising to 34% at ages 10-11. Among the initiatives trying to address obesity through diet, this one stands out for its counterintuitive approach: Shift wants to use low-cost takeaway food, a sector much maligned for its poor nutritional standards, to boost healthy eating. The logic becomes clearer when you consider how much eating habits have changed. Between 2009 and 2016, spending on takeaways rose by 34%, to \\u00a39.9bn a year. Much of this has been fuelled by online delivery: last year, according to the analysts Kantar, the UK hot-food delivery market grew by nearly 20%. This has particular bearing on young adults and parents with young children, who are most likely to be frequent users of food delivery services. According to research by Shift in south London, low-income families are increasingly reliant on takeaways, with some households ordering in three or more times a week. Bek points out the problem is that takeaways, particularly at the cheaper end of the market, are designed not as an everyday option but as a treat. Research published in Nutrition &amp; Food Science in 2014 found that the majority of takeaway meals were excessive for portion size, energy, fat, carbs, protein and salt. Instead of trying to encourage regular takeaway users away from their habit, however, Shift decided to follow the trend. \\u201cOur challenge,\\u201d says Bek, \\u201cwas to ask: How can we populate the market with everyday takeaway that\\u2019s just as convenient, appealing and affordable, but better for families?\\u201d Bek, who is 38, grew up in a working-class suburb of Birmingham and was a furniture designer, before co-founding an online luxury watch store. Looking for a way to make a greater social impact through design, he went back to university in 2016, doing an MA in innovation management at Central Saint Martins, and joined Shift the following year. When we first meet in May 2019, he is full of enthusiasm about the food-delivery project, if a little daunted by the scale of the task. He\\u2019s already done a lot of groundwork. The previous year, Bek and his colleagues spent more than 200 hours with 44 parents and children in low-income households in Lambeth and Southwark, observing their cooking and eating habits and joining them on what they termed \\u201cshop-alongs\\u201d Alert to environmental triggers \\u2013 such as fast-food advertising and sweets next to supermarket tills \\u2013 the researchers attached cameras to the children\\u2019s chests to track exactly what they were looking at, noting how they homed in on particular brands or food types. Each participant kept a food diary for a week, recording what they ate and how it made them feel, and they also consented to having their phone\\u2019s GPS data logged. Their testimonies provide a vivid sense of how challenging it can be to feed yourself and your children healthily, or at all, in circumstances limited by budget, cooking facilities and affordable eating options. \\u201cAfter having my boy I went through a period where we stopped eating, because we was in a shared-kitchen, hostel-type place and I wasn\\u2019t really keen on going, especially because I wasn\\u2019t a good cook \\u2013 I didn\\u2019t want to embarrass myself,\\u201d recalls Donna, a single mother in her 20s. \\u201cI just remember buying crackers and things like that and just eating crackers in my room.\\u201d They also illustrate how takeaway food can become a default in times of stress. \\u201cI got days I love cooking,\\u201d says Meryam, a 35-year-old single parent of three. \\u201cSometimes my body shuts down \\u2013 those are the days when I can\\u2019t really get up and cook, so I will end up either getting takeaway or cooking oven food.\\u201d Having identified the challenge, the next step was to \\u201cstress-test\\u201d the concept. With funding from Birmingham City Council, Shift created a brand called Family Feeds and launched it as a pilot in summer 2018. Over 10 weeks, Bek and Louise Cooper, neither of whom had any catering experience, ran the takeaway from a \\u201cdark\\u201d (delivery-only) kitchen in the deprived suburb of Erdington, where, as it happened, Bek grew up. The focus in the menu was calorie reduction. In testing, Shift had found that the average adult takeaway portion contained 1,155 calories (the NHS recommends a daily intake of 2,000 calories for women, 2,500 for men). The aim for Family Feeds was to reduce it by half: 500-550 for adults and 300-350 for a child portion. \\u201cIf the most regular takeaway consumers were to substitute one high-calorie meal each week with one of ours, then we\\u2019re starting to move the needle,\\u201d reasons Bek. Martin Caraher, professor of food and health policy at City University, has reservations about the calorie-focused approach. \\u201cThis is a crude measure,\\u201d he says. \\u201cMost processed food has trans fats in it, what about that? And the key issue here is vegetable intake.\\u201d Bek acknowledges Caraher\\u2019s concerns, pointing out the quantity of vegetables already on the menu and stressing that calories are just the first step. \\u201cAs we learn more about the types of food that our customers want to eat, we can continue to design the menu in such a way that we can build in more nutrition without losing them,\\u201d he says. The Birmingham trial wasn\\u2019t a money-spinner by any measure \\u2013 they had four or five orders a night \\u2013 but data from Just Eat suggested they were reaching the right audience and the feedback was positive. Returning to London, they approached Guy\\u2019s and St Thomas\\u2019 Charity and were granted \\u00a3350,000 to realise the concept. The stakes this time are much higher: Bek and his team are aiming to create a not-for-profit social enterprise which, by the end of the two-year funding period, will need to sustain itself financially in a highly competitive market. Bek is aware of the pitfalls. \\u201cA lot of the pushback from parents,\\u201d he says, \\u201cis this idea of a waggy finger\\u201d \\u2013 the condescending voice berating poor people for not eating healthily enough. Bek\\u2019s response has been to remove all surface evidence that Medleys is anything other than a commercial enterprise. The decision to enter the takeaway market is another possible source of criticism \\u2013 that by encouraging parents to order in, they are discouraging them from cooking at home. When I ask Bek if he feels compromised by Shift\\u2019s association with Just Eat, which supported both the Birmingham and London projects, he frowns. \\u201cHow else are we going to reach our customers? Our job is to understand people\\u2019s behaviours and work with those behaviours. To fight against it seems just counterintuitive.\\u201d Before they can reach those customers, however, Bek and his team have a business to build from scratch. Over the next six months, I keep a close eye on their progress, from brand and menu development to finding a local chef and a place in which to cook. In August, I visit the Waterloo headquarters of Food Innovation Solutions (FIS), the menu development company Shift have hired to commercialise a selection of 12 dishes. This is the first time Bek and his team have had a chance to taste the results and they\\u2019ve invited a number of people, including Jennie Crossan, a dietician from Evelina London children\\u2019s hospital, and Steve Pooley, an ex-Jamie Oliver chef who drew on consultation with local parents to devise the initial menu. It\\u2019s FIS\\u2019s job to ensure that targets for nutrition and calories, portion size, flavour profile and price point are being met. As in-house chef Alex Dome brings each dish to the table, the assembled tasters pick apart everything from the salt content of the sweet and sour chicken to the exact fineness of the grated cheese covering the pasta bake. That pasta bake may look innocuous, but hidden inside are seven vegetables including peppers, tomatoes, squash and courgettes, blitzed into a smooth red sauce. I\\u2019m surprised by the menu: most of it does feel like a treat. The fish, butter-bean and pepper stew has depth of flavour and a spicy kick, while the lasagne is so comforting that I fail to notice, at first, that lentils have been used to pad out the beef. (\\u201cThis is a dish where we can\\u2019t afford to have just meat, either from a calorie or a cost perspective,\\u201d explains the head of FIS, Nicola Swift.) The one disappointing note is the falafel wrap, the clagginess of which is explained by the falafel being baked instead of deep-fried, for reasons of costs as well as calories. Over the next couple of months, a brand comes together \\u2013 the name Medleys is intended to evoke both variety and greatest-hits-style popularity. Originally slated for late summer, the launch gets pushed back till mid-November \\u2013 the initial kitchen site, at a community centre in Myatts Field, fell through because Lambeth council were concerned about scooter noise. The current kitchen, in Herne Hill, is less than ideal \\u2013 it\\u2019s a shared space, with a full commercial rent, and they have to wheel their gear in and out of a storeroom every day \\u2013 but nevertheless, on 14 November, I\\u2019m on hand to witness the first evening of proper service. It is, inevitably, a slow start, though we all jump up when the first order comes through \\u2013 cheesy cottage pie with a side of greens, and peri-peri chicken with rice, totalling \\u00a316.97. The chef, Charles Johnson, springs into action, heating pre-cooked components and making sure the final dishes are properly seasoned. Johnson, whose previous job was cooking in a nursing home, came on board a couple of months earlier, drawn by the hours \\u2013 he has small children and his partner is a nurse \\u2013 and the social angle. \\u201cI like the idea of providing an option that\\u2019s healthier than what people would otherwise go for,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to be fancy to taste good, look good and appeal to people.\\u201d Right now, most of the dishes come pre-prepared by Food Innovation Solutions, but Johnson is working to bring all food production in-house. For the first three months, Bek acts as Johnson\\u2019s sidekick, taking orders, packaging dishes and delivering some orders himself on his single-speed bike. When I next see him, at the family tasting in late January, he looks exhausted. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been a hard slog,\\u201d he says. Business has been slow to pick up: they had four or five orders a night in the run-up to Christmas, but early January has been dead. Keeping up morale is a daily struggle. Working in a shared space has been challenging, too, but Bek has been able to identify a variety of unforeseen problems. \\u201cEvery day we\\u2019re tweaking things,\\u201d says Johnson. The challenge this evening, more immediately, is to impress the six now-ravenous children and their parents who have gathered in the next-door cafe to give feedback on the Medleys menu. Mohammed and Naheed Suleman and their children Hassan, 10, Hussein, eight, and nine-month-old Aisha, who ordered pasta bake, fish stew and three \\u201cposh\\u201d fish finger wraps, are full of praise. \\u201cThe fish is fantastic,\\u201d says Mohammed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s totally different from how we eat at home, but it\\u2019s good to have a change. We would definitely order again.\\u201d Serena Cunningham is less convinced. \\u201cIt was really fresh and reasonably priced and the portions were the perfect size.\\u201d But would she order again? \\u201cProbably not,\\u201d she says. \\u201cOnly because it\\u2019s the type of thing I can cook anyway. I could make pasta bake and cottage pie at home, because I\\u2019ve always got the ingredients.\\u201d Takeaway, for Cunningham, means food she can\\u2019t make herself. \\u201cLiterally, I don\\u2019t know the recipe for Kentucky,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt needs to feel like a treat for the kids.\\u201d The kids, however, are more positive. \\u201cI loved it,\\u201d says Naila, who screams \\u201cyeah\\u201d when asked if mummy should order it again. \\u201cFive out of five,\\u201d is Noah-Isaac\\u2019s verdict, even though he left half his cottage pie uneaten due to the presence of lentils. \\u201cI only like green peas,\\u201d he murmurs. The analogy that keeps coming back to me, each time I call in on Bek and his team, is that of taking small steps up a big mountain. Professor Martin Caraher underlines this when he says: \\u201cI don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s any one solution to obesity. Obesity is complex: it\\u2019s nutrient intake, but it\\u2019s also activity. No one thing will solve obesity.\\u201d Shift\\u2019s project is part of a solution, he goes on, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s not the solution. Though I do applaud what they\\u2019re doing.\\u201d Bek acknowledged this on our very first meeting, saying: \\u201cA single takeaway in Lambeth is not really going to change childhood obesity. What will change it,\\u201d he went on, \\u201cor what we\\u2019re all hoping for, is a networked approach and a density of options in local areas.\\u201d In our final conversation, at the end of January, Bek is still focused on making this one takeaway commercially viable \\u2013 they\\u2019re getting up to eight orders a night now but need many more than that to break even; Bek hopes that plugging into Uber Eats and Deliveroo in the months ahead will put them in a much better position. But he has been having thoughts, too, about what a more networked approach and a greater density of options might look like in practice. For Bek, hot-food delivery is just one among several ways of making healthier food available to his target audience. Another option is a subscription service for ready-to-cook meals, which parents could collect from local pick-up points \\u2013 outside the school gates, for example. Even if the takeaway picks up, Bek is aware that he could still be doing more. \\u201cThe next thing is local catering,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf somebody said, we\\u2019ve got a 40-person event, can you cater it? Absolutely, we can. We\\u2019ve got a space, we\\u2019ve got the equipment, we\\u2019ve got the people \\u2013 let\\u2019s do it.\\u201d What really interests him, though, is joining forces with like-minded organisations, and creating an example that others \\u2013 entrepreneurs as well as social enterprises \\u2013 will want to replicate. \\u201cMy hunch is that to really make something like this work, it\\u2019s a collective effort,\\u201d he says.\\u201d \\u201cWe really don\\u2019t want to be doing this on our own,\\u201d Bek\\u2019s colleague Rachel Stephenson chips in. \\u201cWe want other people to be doing similar things and collaborating more. It\\u2019s hard enough if you don\\u2019t have a social mission to do a food business,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cBut when you do, it\\u2019s definitely worth us all clubbing together.\\u201d \\u2022 Patrick Bek has now left Shift to become head of new product development at Birmingham City University\\u2019s innovation hub Steamhouse. He has been replaced as venture lead on Medleys by Alice Wilson.

It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? No. In the UK, the medical advice is now that anyone with a cough or high temperature should stay at home for seven days, keeping away from other people, including those in your home if you can. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad. You should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital. Is the virus being transmitted from one person to another? China\\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. There is now extensive human to human transmission across the world. How many people have been affected? As of 15 March, more than 156,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 5,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 73,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus. Why is this worse than normal influenza, and how worried are the experts? We don\\u2019t yet know how dangerous the new coronavirus is, and we won\\u2019t know until more data comes in, but estimates have ranged from well below 1% in the young to over 3% among those who are elderly or have underlying health conditions. Seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%. Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population \\u2013 elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems \\u2013 to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic. Have there been other coronaviruses? Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals. In 2002, Sars spread virtually unchecked to 37 countries, causing global panic, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing more than 750. Mers appears to be less easily passed from human to human, but has greater lethality, killing 35% of about 2,500 people who have been infected.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 545}, {\"title\": \"UK coronavirus crisis 'to last until spring 2021 and could see 7.9m hospitalised'\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-coronavirus-crisis-to-last-until-spring-2021-and-could-see-79m-hospitalised\", \"content\": \"The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals. The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for another 12 months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS. It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\\u2019s chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population \\u201care expected\\u201d to contract the virus. The document says that: \\u201cAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.\\u201d The briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the public\\u2019s health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport. It has been drawn up in recent days by PHE\\u2019s emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by Dr Susan Hopkins, PHE\\u2019s lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in Engand. \\u201cFor the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that\\u201d, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. \\u201cA year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn\\u2019t well appreciated or understood,\\u201d added Hunter, an expert in epidemiology. \\u201cI think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,\\u201d he added. The admission that the virus will continue to cause problems for another year appears to undermine hopes that the arrival of warmer weather this summer would kill it. The document also discloses that an estimated 500,000 of the 5 million people deemed vital because they work \\u201cin essential services and critical infrastructure\\u201d will be off sick at any one time during a month-long peak of the epidemic. The 5 million include 1m NHS staff and 1.5 million in social care. However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: \\u201cIt is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\\u201d Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days. The document also states that: The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are \\u201cunder significant demand pressures\\u201d. From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested. Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients. A senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing \\u201csurge\\u201d in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying. If the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths. But if Whitty\\u2019s insistence that the rate will be closer to 0.6% proves accurate, then that would involve 318,660 people dying. Experts advising governments worldwide on the way epidemics grow and eventually decline say there will be a rapid rise in cases to a peak \\u2013 and then a falling off. Whitty, who has seen the modelling done by UK and global scientists, says the case numbers will go up fast over the next 10 to 14 weeks. That will mean a peak at around the end of May to mid-June, when the NHS will be under great pressure. The strategy of all countries is to delay that peak and stretch it out over a longer period of time, so that health services are better able to cope. There is also the possibility that new treatments will be available by then. After the peak, case numbers and deaths are expected to drop for 10 weeks or more, until they reach a fairly low level, which may not be zero. In the summer months especially, the case numbers are expected to reduce because people spend more time out of doors and are less likely to be confined at close quarters in small rooms in a house or office with people who are infected. There is still a worry that the virus could resurge in the autumn or winter months, which means planning for the long term will be necessary. Until a vaccine is developed, perhaps in 18 months, health planners cannot be sure of being able to protect people from the disease.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 911}, {\"title\": \"Stopping the rot: the fight to save fresh food\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/15/a-new-way-to-extend-the-life-and-fruit-and-vegetables\", \"content\": \"Ten years ago, James Rogers was driving through some of the most productive farmland on the planet, thinking about food. He had recently read an article detailing the challenges of feeding the world\\u2019s growing population, and as he gazed out over the fertile fields of the Salinas Valley outside Monterey, California, he thought: how is it possible that people go hungry, that people starve, when growing food seems so simple? \\u201cYou just take these magic beans and...\\u201d Rogers, recalling the thought, casts his hand as if tossing seed on the ground. \\u201cI realise it\\u2019s a bit more complicated than that, but, still\\u2026\\u201d Back then, Rogers was a PhD student in material sciences at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). He wasn\\u2019t working in anything food-related at all. His PhD research involved creating a kind of paint that, when dried, turned into a solar panel. There was a lab up in Berkeley that had the equipment necessary for his studies, but between the lab and his home in Santa Barbara, he passed the farmland, and the food problem gnawed at him. He wondered if it wasn\\u2019t merely as simple as he supposed. He began taking classes in environmental economics and natural resources. He learned that, globally, we are indeed producing more than enough food. The problem isn\\u2019t production, it\\u2019s what happens next. We waste an extraordinary amount of food. In America it\\u2019s about 40%; in the UK, nearly the same. Around the world, almost a third of all the food produced \\u2013 approximately 1.3bn tonnes \\u2013 is lost one way or another each year. Much of the time it\\u2019s not merely lost, but brought into our homes only to be chucked in the bin, and then transported to a landfill, where it slowly releases methane back into the atmosphere, actively warming the Earth. Worldwide, a staggering 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. The question for Rogers was: what exactly was driving so much waste? One day, while researching, he came across another article. He can still recall its first line: \\u201cAll fresh produce is seasonal as well as perishable.\\u201d That insight \\u2013 so simple, so true \\u2013 struck him like a lightning bolt. \\u201cThe problem,\\u201d he recalls, \\u201cis you\\u2019re either in season and have more than you know what to do with, or you have nothing.\\u201d Plenty of animals have adapted to these natural cycles of boom and bust, fat times and lean: birds migrate, bears hibernate. Humans trade, converting this surplus into a non-perishable asset we call money. Some of the earliest forms of currency were, in fact, grains stored in clay pots. And clay pottery, Rogers is quick to point out, was one of material science\\u2019s very first breakthroughs. Clay pottery allowed us to continue eating long after the harvest. But clay pottery only got us so far. It was what material science might offer food today that interested him. He decided, then, to switch tracks. No longer would he work on paint that dried into solar panels. He would instead begin to work on increasing the shelf life of fruit and vegetables. Eventually, he developed a substance that wasn\\u2019t entirely dissimilar from the solar paint. This substance, however, was made entirely out of plant lipids, or fatty acids. Spray it on to an avocado, say, and the substance dries into a sort of second skin, which increases the avocado\\u2019s shelf life by two to three times. The company Rogers founded, Apeel Sciences, is currently growing by hundreds of employees a year, backed by tens of millions of dollars in venture capital, and is revolutionising entire food systems and economies. But back then, in 2010, driving past those fertile fields, it was still early days. Rogers remembers calling his mother and telling her the news about his insight \\u2013 the big switch in his interests and research. \\u201cSweetie,\\u201d she said to him. \\u201cThat sounds really nice. But you don\\u2019t know anything about fruit and vegetables.\\u201d Apeel Sciences is headquartered in Goleta, California, just north of UCSB and south of farmland that quickly gives way to the rural, rolling Central California coast. The company\\u2019s 100,000 sq ft building was formerly home to a medical-device maker and the labs and clean rooms easily swapped from their previous purpose \\u2013 building prototypes for entry into the human body \\u2013 to their current one: the study of the molecular structures of fruit\\u2019s skin. \\u201cThis room is part of our food-manufacturing practice,\\u201d says Molly Greathouse, who is giving me a tour. We peer in, but the lab is dark and empty and appears abandoned. \\u201cIt\\u2019s still being set up,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWe\\u2019re still putting wires into things.\\u201d Her colleague, Daniel Costanza, is my other guide. Both are recent hires, but recent is relative: Apeel\\u2019s employee count rose in the past six months from 130 to more than 200, so Greathouse, who has been here for nearly a year-and-a-half, counts as a seasoned veteran. We pass another lab, a clean room that houses, among other bacteria, E coli and listeria. The lights are on, and along one wall is another big door topped by a glowing red light. Here, Greathouse says, is where Apeel\\u2019s scientists put fruit and vegetables through a battery of tests mimicking conditions they might face while in transit. What happens when refrigeration shuts down? What happens when a contaminated batch of food is nearby, hence the reason for the dangerous bacteria. There are cascading effects to prolonging the shelf life of produce. Costanza describes how one of the suppliers they work with no longer uses plastic wrap on cucumbers now that Apeel\\u2019s spray is in the mix. It\\u2019s a seemingly small change that quickly adds up. In a single year, that one move will save enough plastic wrap to enfold the Empire State Building 11 times over. \\u201cImagine adding that to each food category throughout the globe,\\u201d Costanza says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a huge paradigm shift away from single-use plastics. It\\u2019s pretty crazy.\\u201d Costanza drops his voice, getting serious. \\u201cThis is the type of technology you look back on as revolutionary. I hold it up there with electricity or the internet. There are so many lives we can affect in a positive way. And we have such tight intellectual property no one\\u2019s really able to replicate it \\u2013 we don\\u2019t really have competition.\\u201d They do, really. There\\u2019s Hazel Technologies, which is based in Chicago and makes little packets that get stashed in produce boxes. The packets alter the atmosphere within the box, slowing the food\\u2019s response to ethylene, a chemical that fruit and vegetables emit as they age that causes a breakdown in colour and texture. A similar company in the UK, called It\\u2019s Fresh, makes ethylene filters, too, and recently received a $10m investment from AgroFresh, a company that sells a dozen or so products including fungicides and wax coatings, all of which aim to prolong produce shelf life and enhance their look. There\\u2019s also Cambridge Crops, from Massachusetts, which makes a similar edible protective coating to Apeel, using silk proteins rather than plant lipids. Cambridge Crops received $4m in seed funding from the MIT venture fund last year, whereas Apeel recently landed $70m from the Silicon Valley fund Andreessen Horowitz, which has famously backed Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb and Soylent, the meal-replacement drink company. All of these companies and investors are making a play for a market worth at least $218bn in the US, and several times that worldwide. That number \\u2013 $218bn \\u2013 is about how much grocery stores, restaurants and people at home spend on food that simply gets thrown away per year, according to ReFed, a food waste-reduction nonprofit based in Berkeley, California. ReFed also estimates that, last year, venture capitalists invested about $185m in technologies to combat food waste. People have been trying to preserve fruit and vegetables for at least as long as they\\u2019ve been putting grains in clay pots. We dry it in the sun (12,000 BC) or jam it (600 AD) or cure it (1400 AD), or cool it or can it, pasteurise it or vacuum seal it. The practice of coating a fruit in wax to seal its freshness and enhance its appearance is at least several centuries old, and today you\\u2019d be hard pressed to find a supermarket apple without it. Today, wax seals also contain antifungal properties, which are perfectly safe, and are applied in so thin a layer as to be pretty much insignificant. What sets Apeel apart is its specific coating technology \\u2013 the fact that it works more effectively than a wax and is an organic additive made from plant parts. That, and the company\\u2019s comparatively huge cash influx from Silicon Valley, and its truly global reach. Apeel is already well on its way to spanning the globe. It has satellite offices in Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands and New Jersey, and it works with five different suppliers of avocados, including Del Monte and Del Rey, which are two of the largest. It also works with Sage Fruit, one of Washington state\\u2019s largest organic apple growers. Greathouse and Costanza shepherd me past the analytical sciences lab, where the fruit is run through a series of taste and smell tests to make sure that the Apeel spray essentially disappears as soon as it\\u2019s applied. This is a complex task. The spray can be made of the lipids from any plant \\u2013 much of the source crop for their ingredients changes throughout the year, and is simply the excess or discarded produce from farms and vineyards \\u2013 but it has to be molecularly reconstituted to act more or less exactly like the specific fruit on which it is sprayed. We arrive at yet another lab, this one home to the material sciences team \\u2013 the beating heart of the Apeel operation. Here, they use liquid gases to separate specific molecules from the lipid slurry, then reconfigure those molecules into a variety of combinations, essentially highly educated hunches as to what a specific fruit or vegetable\\u2019s skin might be like. If this seems like a lot of tedious guesswork, it is. The research and development for Apeel\\u2019s first product, a coating for avocados, took eight years. Now we\\u2019re in a bright room lined with racks of mouldering strawberries and bananas. Well, some are mouldering, some are not. Each rack has a camera mounted and set to a timer, to scan the fruit and track its breakdown. Some of the fruit has been sprayed with the Apeel spray, some has not. Tim, an engineer and overseer of the rotting fruit, apologises for the fruit fly situation in the room. Finally, our tour ends in a warehouse at the back of the building. The space is dominated by huge produce sorting and cleaning machines, rigged with a custom-made Apeel spray device that treats the fruit or vegetables at the very last step of the process. \\u201cIt feels like moisturiser,\\u201d Greathouse says, describing the spray. It is odourless and tasteless, too. Once, when Greathouse tried some of it on her hand, she thought, \\u201cMaybe I can shave with this.\\u201d In fact, she adds, \\u201cThe reason we wrinkle is oxidation and moisture loss \\u2013 same as fruit. I want to do an experiment with one half of my face on Apeel, one half not, and then see what happens.\\u201d James Rogers, the CEO, has an office filled with avocados. Some are pillows, some figurines, some are squishy stress balls shaped like avocados, some are the genuine article. Rogers loves avos. \\u201cThe joke with the av is: not now, not now, not now. Now? Too late,\\u201d he says. But: \\u201cWhen you get an Apeel avocado the joke no longer makes sense,\\u201d because the fruit stays ripe for so long. The window to enjoy it, previously so fleeting, has been stretched by weeks. The one fruit he loves even more, though, is the strawberry. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s not sexy, but it\\u2019s just my favourite,\\u201d he says. \\u201cAnd they go bad so quickly.\\u201d The company is a few years into R&amp;D on that one. \\u201cWhen I can go pick up local Apeel strawberries in the summer and have them last until winter in my fridge, that\\u2019s when I know we\\u2019ll have made it.\\u201d These days, Rogers spends less time in material science and more on distribution chains. It turns out, when you create a new technology that extends the shelf life of produce, it creates another problem central to the whole business: who, exactly, does this create value for? The perishability of a fruit or veg dictates everything about its supply chain. Everything from when you pick it, right down to the season and the time of the day, to where it\\u2019s packed, in the field or a packing shed. Is it then force air-cooled, or hydro-cooled? Does it travel down a flume or a conveyor belt? Does it go in a bag? Or does it get boxed? Does it go in a box with big holes or small holes? Does it go into a shipping container? Does it go into an aeroplane? Does it go into a display in the grocery store? When it goes home with you, does it go in the fridge? Or does it go on your counter? Within every supply chain for every different fruit or vegetable lies economic opportunity. The goal for each of Apeel\\u2019s produce lines, Rogers says, is that the savings accrued by the growers or grocers are so great that you and I are actually paying less for their fruit and vegetables in the market. This is crucial, because \\u2013 yes \\u2013 while it\\u2019s good for the environment and will cut down on waste, feeling good about what you buy can only rope in so many consumers; the rest, the real revolution, lies in sheer economic price cutting. A cheaper piece of fruit that will last four times as long? No one will pass that bargain up. Where things start to get truly interesting, from a market perspective, is how this opens up whole new avenues of produce to put in front of people. Just as perishability dictates everything about its supply chain, how well a fruit or vegetable travels is the most important characteristic of any mass-produced produce. The best example of this is the banana. Nearly every banana sold in supermarkets is a variety called the Cavendish. The Cavendish isn\\u2019t particularly tasty, as banana varieties go. Nor is it especially packed with nutrients. There are far better bananas out there. But none travel \\u2013 stay firm and unripe quite as long \\u2013 like the Cavendish. Only, the Cavendish is falling victim to its own success, and a fungus is rampaging through this particular variety. So diversity in our produce isn\\u2019t just a nice thing for us as eaters, it\\u2019s essential for our future food security. Just up the road from Apeel\\u2019s headquarters is a farm growing a strange kind of finger-shaped lime. When cut open, the flesh appears pearled, like caviar, which is why it\\u2019s known as a caviar lime. The farm\\u2019s caviar limes are a speciality item, trucked to high-end restaurants in LA and flown to New York for the same purpose. The limes last for 7-10 days after they\\u2019ve been picked. But Apeel started working with the farm a few years ago, and was able to develop a spray that worked. A fruit with a shorter window of ripeness actually speeds up the development process, because you are able to quickly see what\\u2019s working, and what\\u2019s not. Now this fruit that was so highly specialised, appearing for just one weekend in a farmer\\u2019s market, and in a few dishes in fancy restaurants, can be sold in supermarkets. The caviar limes weren\\u2019t Rogers\\u2019 idea. Some of his scientists became infatuated with the problem and went to work on it. But now, he sees how this might be the future: new fruit and heirloom vegetables: the weirder, more specialised, small-batch stuff, brought to the masses.

The best way of making a house a home is to build things up over time, with things that hold memories. It\\u2019s not about buying everything brand new, off the rack. It could be a picture you pick up at a car-boot sale and give a frame six months later, but then it fits that perfect spot on the wall that has been missing something.\\u201d Switch it off Turn off overhead lights, says the interior designer Joanna Plant, and get several lamps instead. \\u201cI\\u2019ve counted mine in my sitting room and I\\u2019ve got eight,\\u201d she says. Lamps can be bought inexpensively from high-street chains or charity shops such as those run by the British Heart Foundation. \\u201cLighting is one of the most important things,\\u201d says Plant. \\u201cYou can have a beautiful interior, but if it\\u2019s badly lit, it\\u2019s going to feel awful.\\u201d Freshen up \\u201cPaint is great for cleaning rooms up,\\u201d says Stedman. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have to be expensive; if you\\u2019re doing it to make it fresh and clean, bog-standard white paint looks great.\\u201d She used old paint left over from her last house, and donated by friends, in her home.

Chande suggests spending money on interesting pillowcases to go with cheaper, plain white bed linen, and buying potted herbs to brighten up kitchens and dining rooms. Pick up a selection of different picture frames from boot sales or charity shops, and frame things that mean something to you. \\u201cIt could be a menu from a restaurant you went to on a special occasion or postcards,\\u201d says Chande. \\u201cA collection of small pictures together in smaller spaces is very effective.

Unlike our nearest neighbours, ministers said there would be no imminent ban on mass events because such a prohibition would do no good. On Friday night it was announced that there would be such a proscription. The government then had to make a U-turn this weekend over its message that the UK is pursuing a policy of \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d. It was troubling \\u2013 and reflects badly on ministers \\u2013 that an epidemiological outcome of mass infection was confused with the dubious policy aim of building resistance in the population. The muddled thinking at the heart of government will not engender public confidence. The spectre of mass deaths and possible chaos in an under-funded NHS hangs over ministerial indecision. This is the worst public health crisis for a generation and the government must respond to a level of scrutiny of its policies that some ministers have been, perhaps, unaccustomed to. This is especially true of senior figures who had got used to dismissing criticism as unpatriotic. The buck stops in Downing Street and the prime minister must take a lead. Britain has some simple lessons to learn if it is to avoid fatalities. It should follow some basic principles of transparency in keeping the public informed. Publishing the appropriately anonymised scientific advice and data sets that inform government decisions must be a priority. Voters are expected to take it on trust that ministers are making the right decisions. This faith is shaken when the public sees other countries taking more drastic steps. There may be good reasons for a divergence of policy response, but it is worrying that ministerial explanations do not convince many experts. The government had resisted clamping down hard with strict quarantine and social distancing of the kind successfully implemented in China, because ministers said this would lead to fatigue and allow the virus to make a comeback. Yet on Sunday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said emergency laws to quarantine people deemed a threat to public health would be put forward. The other model for tackling Covid-19 is South Korea\\u2019s massive free testing and treatment, which has corralled the disease and kept new infection rates low. In the UK, government MPs claim the concern is that the testing is inaccurate and that a false result may lead to more infections. If the past few weeks are anything to go by, ministers will be walking back from this too. The government policy to combat Covid-19 should be guided by science, but is ultimately a political decision. There will be an imperative to avoid an epidemic peak that overwhelms the NHS and to soften the blow to the economy. Both pose ideological questions for the government. How far and fast does it intervene to requisition beds in the private sector to increase capacity is a question that exposes the shrunken state of the health service. A prime minister who has in the past treated business as a nuisance now finds he needs industry to help address the shortage of ventilators. While the headlines scream of a war footing, the government appears hesitant and unsure in the face of a crisis. Britain\\u2019s response compared with the speed and aggression of that pursued by other European countries carries political dangers. The first is that the government reaction does not match the severity of the threat the nation faces. The second is that experts have underestimated the public\\u2019s stamina and resilience to maintain discipline in a lockdown \\u2013 or in a mass testing regime. The third is that the government has not specifically said the state will ensure the burden of the coronavirus outbreak will be borne equally. It might be that relying on the market and appealing to the public\\u2019s good nature and understanding is enough. But if it is not, as the historian Jonathan Boff notes, \\u201cthere is more at risk, from what will look with hindsight like complacency and a lack of concern with equal sacrifice, than Mr Johnson\\u2019s political future\\u201d.

In a lunchtime briefing at the White House on Saturday, the president confirmed he had taken a test for the virus after coming into contact with a Brazilian government official last week in Florida who later tested positive for the disease. The president\\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, said in a statement on Saturday evening that Trump\\u2019s test was negative. \\u201cOne week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago [in Florida], the president remains symptom-free,\\u201d Conley said in his memo. \\u201cI have been in daily contact with the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and White House Coronavirus Task Force, and we are encouraging the implementation of all their best practices for exposure reduction and transmission mitigation.\\u201d Dr Conley had said on Friday that there was no need to quarantine the president or implement a test because the encounter with Bolsonaro aide Fabio Wajngarten was \\u201clow risk\\u201d. But on Saturday it was reported that Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, who was also at Mar-a-Lago, had been tested after displaying relevant symptoms. On Saturday, Trump told the media he had taken a test on Friday night after all, announcing it at a press conference to which reporters were admitted only after having their temperatures taken, and from which one unidentified journalist was turned away. Trump\\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump entered self-isolation on Friday after meeting an Australian politician later revealed to have tested positive. News of Trump\\u2019s test followed days of controversy highlighted by his continuing to shake hands with people, even as official advice recommended \\u201csocial distancing\\u201d. \\u201cIt becomes a habit.

The vice-president, Mike Pence, duly announced that travelers from the UK and Ireland would be subject to the ban from midnight US eastern time on Monday. The president also raised the prospect of some kind of domestic travel restrictions, and advised the public: \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t have to travel I wouldn\\u2019t do it.\\u201d Trump welcomed legislation passed by the US House that will help fund paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, free testing and other measures to help Americans affected by the coronavirus pandemic. \\u201cIt will provide strong support for American families and communities in dealing with the coronavirus,\\u201d he said. Nonetheless, the administration\\u2019s response remains subject to criticism, particularly after the press conference on Friday. There, Trump announced a national emergency, paving the way for billions of dollars to be made accessible to authorities attempting to slow the pandemic. \\u201cIt opened up avenues we would never be able to open up without it,\\u201d he said at the Saturday briefing. \\u201cIt will make more than $50bn available to us in disaster relief funds. And that\\u2019s available for states, territories and local governments. A lot of people are benefiting from it.\\u201d But on Friday Trump also announced a new self-diagnosis website created by Google, only for the tech giant to deny the project was on anything like the scale outlined; said \\u201cI don\\u2019t take responsibility at all\\u201d when asked why the US lagged behind other countries in testing; and reacted angrily to a question about why a White House office for pandemic response was closed in 2018. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC), there are 1,629 cases of coronavirus in the US with 41 deaths, and 46 states and the District of Columbia have reported infections. Other estimates, including Trump\\u2019s, are higher. Concerns have been expressed that the US does not have enough hospital beds or ventilators. As many as 20% of coronavirus infections could require patients to receive mechanical ventilation. If estimates of more than 1m infections prove accurate, there could be more than 200,000 such cases. According to a Johns Hopkins study based on data from 2010, US acute care hospitals own about 62,000 full-featured ventilators. The study, published in February, reported an additional 98,000 that can provide basic function. The CDC Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) has an estimated 8,900 ventilators. At the White House on Friday, Trump said: \\u201cWe have ordered a large number of respirators just in case.\\u201d Across the US, authorities have declared emergencies, closed schools and restricted public gatherings. In New York City the largest public school system in the US remains open, a key support for millions. Pressure on the mayor, Bill de Blasio, is increasing. New York\\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced on Saturday that the state had recorded its first coronavirus fatality, an 82-year-old woman with pre-existing medical issues. Cuomo said the state had 524 confirmed cases, 117 hospitalised, but said officials believe thousands have the virus. On Capitol Hill, the relief bill passed just before 1am, after two days of talks between the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Agreement came after Trump signaled his support. Pelosi thanked Democrats for their patience. Trump and the speaker never communicated directly and Trump did not thank Pelosi directly on Saturday. The legislation now goes to the Senate. It ensures free testing for those who need it while increasing access to benefits including family medical leave, paid sick leave, unemployment insurance, spending on health insurance for the poor and food programmes for children and the elderly. On Friday, a federal judge blocked an administration attempt to force nearly 700,000 people off food stamps, a key benefit for poor Americans. District court judge Beryl Howell cited the coronavirus outbreak and said the attempted action was capricious, arbitrary and probably unlawful.

The system would be failing even under a halfway competent president. The dirty little secret, which will soon become apparent to all, is that there is no real public health system in the United States. The ad hoc response fashioned late Friday by House Democrats and the White House may help a bit, although it\\u2019s skimpy, as I\\u2019ll explain. As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it. Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job. At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word \\u201cpublic\\u201d \\u2013 as in public health, public education or public welfare \\u2013 means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good. Contrast this with America\\u2019s financial system. The Federal Reserve concerns itself with the health of financial markets as a whole. Late last week the Fed made $1.5tn available to banks, at the slightest hint of difficulties making trades. No one batted an eye. When it comes to the health of the nation as a whole, money like this isn\\u2019t available. And there are no institutions analogous to the Fed with responsibility for overseeing and managing the public\\u2019s health \\u2013 able to whip out a giant checkbook at a moment\\u2019s notice to prevent human, rather than financial, devastation. Even if a test for the Covid-19 virus had been developed and approved in time, no institutions are in place to administer it to tens of millions of Americans free of charge. Local and state health departments are already bare bones, having lost nearly a quarter of their workforce since 2008, according to the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Healthcare in America is delivered mainly by private for-profit corporations which, unlike financial institutions, are not required to maintain reserve capacity. As a result, the nation\\u2019s supply of ventilators isn\\u2019t nearly large enough to care for projected numbers of critically ill coronavirus victims unable to breathe for themselves. Its 45,000 intensive care unit beds fall woefully short of the 2.9 million likely to be needed. The Fed can close banks to quarantine financial crises but the US can\\u2019t close workplaces because the nation\\u2019s social insurance system depends on people going to work. Almost 30% of American workers have no paid sick leave from their employers, including 70% of low-income workers earning less than $10.49 an hour. Vast numbers of self-employed workers cannot afford sick leave. Friday\\u2019s deal between House Democrats and the White House won\\u2019t have much effect because it exempts large employers and offers waivers to smaller ones. Most jobless Americans don\\u2019t qualify for unemployment insurance because they haven\\u2019t worked long enough in a steady job and the ad-hoc deal doesn\\u2019t alter this. Meanwhile, more than 30 million Americans have no health insurance. Eligibility for Medicaid, food stamps and other public assistance is now linked to having or actively looking for work. It\\u2019s hard to close public schools because most working parents cannot afford childcare. Many poor children rely on school lunches for their only square meal a day. In Los Angeles, about 80% of students qualify for free or reduced lunches and just under 20,000 are homeless at some point during the school year. There is no public health system in the US, in short, because the richest nation in the world has no capacity to protect the public as a whole, apart from national defense. Ad-hoc remedies such as House Democrats and the White House fashioned on Friday are better than nothing, but they don\\u2019t come close to filling this void.

Last Friday alone, my quick review of reporting across web and print found that more than 90 Guardian journalists wrote in some way about the new coronavirus. Reflecting the impact of Covid-19, coverage went right across specialisms, including politics, business, sport, transport, culture, education and food. It even reached the chess column. Since the first death was reported in China on 11 January, teams have worked around the clock and globe to report and explain this now-pandemic disease. Through words, visuals and audio, including a new twice-weekly Science Weekly Extra podcast, they have sometimes produced upwards of 100 pieces of content a day. Five journalists at the forefront spoke in Saturday\\u2019s pages about the challenges of reporting on an unknown disease, with the Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, describing it as one of \\u201cthe most complicated, difficult and important stories I have covered\\u201d. All talked of the high-stakes responsibility of getting it right. A sense of how much readers are relying on this journalism is seen in the extraordinary numbers. Millions are coming daily to the live blog, while a continually updated explainer from Sarah Boseley, Hannah Devlin and Martin Belam is now the Guardian\\u2019s most read piece ever. I asked the Guardian\\u2019s deputy editor, Owen Gibson, how Covid-19 compared with previous stories of significance. \\u201cIn terms of its open-ended and fast-moving nature, the number of overlapping strands, the requirement to balance the global with the local, and the pressing need for expertise and context, it\\u2019s hard to think of many other stories that have become so all-pervasive for such a long period,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs a result, we\\u2019ve brought different desks \\u2013 and correspondents around the world \\u2013 together in new ways to be able to better inform our coverage.\\u201d There are three formal news meetings on coronavirus every day in which desks liaise on stories. Issues of proportionality and tone are regularly discussed, with advice also circulated on use of language. As Nick Hopkins, executive editor of news, says, \\u201csingle words can make a difference\\u201d. Readers are listened to on this, and any concerns forwarded to relevant staff. Dramatic words, such as \\u201csurge\\u201d for example, which appeared in a 5 March headline as UK cases rose to 116, are now used advisedly.

The 'satire' feels a little too real | Jessa Crispin\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/the-hunt-movie-satire-too-real\", \"content\": \"My entertainment options this week were a movie in which \\u201cliberal elites\\u201d hunt down and murder \\u201cdeplorables\\u201d for sport \\u2013 deaths that are ultra gory and played for laughs \\u2013 and a Hulu documentary in which Hillary Clinton explains with a chuckle and a smile why the policies supported by her 2016 opponent, Bernie Sanders \\u2013 policies like universal healthcare and prison reform, which would help countless Americans \\u2013 are just not \\u201cdoable\\u201d. In other words, essentially the same thing. The Hunt was supposed to be released last fall, but it was put on hold after some people wondered if a movie about political polarity and divisiveness in contemporary society, in which a bunch of poor people die violently was really going to be a good idea. Released now, the controversy is its main selling point. And \\u2013 since we are in the beginning stages of a pandemic for which the United States is not remotely prepared and in which the uninsured, elderly, and poor are much more likely to die \\u2013 well, let\\u2019s just say the timing creates a certain tone. The co-writer and producer Damon Lindelof \\u2013 who recently read the legendary anti-fascist comic Watchmen and thought, huh, okay, but what if instead we made the cops the heroes? \\u2013 has created a world where a group of rich, NPR-listening liberals, who bicker about gendered language and whether \\u201cblack\\u201d or \\u201cAfrican-American\\u201d is the more acceptable term, drug, abduct, and murder Trump voters for sport. One of the Trump voters actually isn\\u2019t a Trump voter but is brought there by mistake, and not being a redneck hillbilly idiot, she manages to fight back. I think that\\u2019s a metaphor. For something. Ultimately the film wants to pretend to be a commentary on cancel culture and our new culture wars. It turns out the whole plan for liberal elites to hunt deplorables becomes a reality because deplorables can\\u2019t take a joke about liberal elites hunting deplorables. The slapstick deaths are supposed to indicate that hey, we\\u2019re just playing around here, rather than show a callous disregard for human life on the part of the film-makers. And if you don\\u2019t find it funny to watch a woman impaled on spikes or a man blown up on a landmine or a woman choking to death after she\\u2019s poisoned, you must be one of those humorless cancel culture freaks who need to learn to take a joke. But of course if you\\u2019re from and of the coasts it\\u2019s easy to believe these new culture wars are just about a difference of opinion about gun control or abortion and not about the hopelessness and loss of meaning and instability causing the deaths of despair killing white middle Americans without college degrees through suicide and addiction. It\\u2019s similar to how one segment of the population will remember the culture wars of the 1990s as a discussion about whether a crucifix of Jesus Christ submerged in urine should be considered art, and not about whether the thousands of gay people, IV drug users, hemophiliacs, and others deemed ultimately disposable by the government and society should have been allowed to die from Aids. Or as a debate about whether children should be exposed to vulgarity in music, and not about whether black people or people in poor neighborhoods should be murdered, brutalized, and harassed by the police forces that claim to protect them. It\\u2019s not clear that anyone involved with this film has ever even been to the south. The star, Betty Gilpin, plays a working-class woman named Crystal who spends the entirety of the film holding her jaw as if she is trying not to let any spit from the chewing tobacco dribble out, and yet at no time does she partake in chewing tobacco. It\\u2019s like she saw a picture of someone once and thought, Oh, that must be how they do it down there, but no one explained to her it\\u2019s not just that all southerners have a severe underbite. But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \\u2026 uh, let\\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess. I\\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \\u201cOh my God, that\\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\\u201d And then they\\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \\u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy. Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\\u2019s a metaphor.

French mountain resorts closed at midnight on Saturday, hours after tens of thousands of skiers had landed for their annual holiday in the snow. Leading ski and summer activity holiday company Neilson has called for the government to step in with \\u201cemergency measures\\u201d. There were reports of chaos and confusion across the Alps with one source saying local police had taken the French government\\u2019s message into their own hands and were going round hotels and restaurants telling marooned Britons to go home immediately. Diane Palumbo, sales and marketing director at SkiWorld, said she had 900 customers across the Alps and they had been in talks with all the key resorts on Friday to warn them that if they were to close, not to do so on Saturday when a fresh influx of tourists were scheduled to arrive. \\u201cWe are getting over our anger. It was literally not until 10pm last night that we were confident of the information we were receiving. The same people who had assured us on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday that they would remain open, have now all closed,\\u201d she said. The French prime minister, \\u00c9douard Philippe, announced at 8pm that the country must close all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops from midnight. Although ski resorts were not specifically listed, the ski industry in the UK believe they are all closing. One of the biggest operators, Inghams, said \\u201cas a responsible tour operator\\u201d it would not be operating any more holidays to French resorts for the rest of the season and advised those who were due to go out on Sunday to abandon their plans. \\u201cEven though the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice has not changed, as a responsible tour operator, we will not be operating Inghams ski holidays to these resorts for the rest of the 2019/2020 winter season: Alpe d\\u2019Huez, Avoriaz, Chamonix &amp; Les Houches, Courchevel, Flaine, La Clusaz, La Plagne, Les Arcs, Les Menuires, Les 2 Alpes, M\\u00e9ribel, Montgenevre, Morzine, Samoens, Serre Chevalier, Tignes, Val d\\u2019Is\\u00e8re and Val Thorens,\\u201d it said in a statement on its website. Palumbo said all those who had booked through an Atol-backed agent would get their money back but that small- to medium-sized tour operators and travel companies could go bust. \\u201cThe airlines are very quick to ask for help from the government but this is a massive flow of people which will costs the industry millions. If the government does not step in travel companies will start to fail because the cost of repatriation will be enormous,\\u201d she said. She explained that travel companies pay bonds to cover emergencies but if travel companies go to the wall the money will have to come out of government coffers. If they are going to bail out travellers at the end of this, would it not be better to step in earlier in the crisis and in doing so save businesses and jobs as well as holidaymakers, she argued. David Taylor, the chief executive of Neilson holidays, said it was \\u201chugely disappointed\\u201d that it received \\u201csuch short notice\\u201d on the closures. He called for \\u201cemergency measures\\u201d for the sector. \\u201cWith the Covid-19 crisis likely to last several months, we are asking the government to consider emergency measures specifically targeted at the travel and leisure sector to deliver immediate relief and help avoid widespread failures. \\u201cThis remains an isolated issue on 2020 departures only and we are confident that next year will see a healthy recovery provided a swathe of relief measures recommended to the government are enacted,\\u201d he said.

It\\u2019s certainly the title and subject of the award-winning tome by Mark Diacono. The cookbook, published last year, has brought an element of vitality to my kitchen, holding my hand through my first batches of kimchi and sourdough bread. Perceptions towards sourness in wine have changed enormously. Where once it would have been a term of abuse, it\\u2019s now at least occasionally accepted as praise. It\\u2019s a matter of moderation. I enjoy the wincing sensation of the sour in wine, provided it doesn\\u2019t take over completely (I\\u2019m not in the market for vinegar) and it\\u2019s balanced by other elements, such as the crisp apple, grapefruit and salty minerals in Gorka Izagirre\\u2019s otherwise bracing Basque dry white. Simpsons Chalklands Classic Cuv\\u00e9e, Kent, England 2016 (\\u00a322.95, Roberson Wine) Gorka Izagirre\\u2019s is a refined version of one of those styles that only makes sense in context. There are some very sour examples of Txacoli which are perfectly fine when drunk with seafood in the Basque country. Another place with a reputation for sour is the UK. In lesser vintages, when the growing season has been too cold and wet to ripen the grapes, English whites can feel like sucking an unripe gooseberry. Even the best English wines have a slight touch of the tinglingly acidic. But, again, that only becomes attractive when it\\u2019s just one element of many, as it is in the increasingly excellent range of sparkling wines. In one of my current favourites that tangy twang provides an energising note in among the subtle baker\\u2019s shop and ripe apple of Simpsons\\u2019s Kentish fizz. Burlotto Dolcetto d\\u2019Alba, Italy 2018 (\\u00a316.95, Lea &amp; Sandeman) The absolute masters of sour in red wine are the Italians. There\\u2019s an understanding that sourness can act as both a mouth-freshening agent and as a kind of base-layer around which all the other elements in the wine can circulate. So many Italian red wines have this element of the sour-tang, which may be reminiscent of the smarting of plum skins or the tartness of just-ripe cherries. The sour is a big part of the appeal in the Piedmont variety barbera, for example, both in a cheerfully rustic example, such as the Co-op Irresistible Barbera d\\u2019Asti 2016 (\\u00a37.50, the Co-op), and as a background hum in Andrea Oberto\\u2019s glorious Barbera d\\u2019Alba 2017 (\\u00a317.50, Lea &amp; Sandeman), while the sweet-sourness of black cherries is part of the appeal in a gorgeous, supple and vibrantly juicy dolcetto from Burlotto.

Opened in 1915, and funded by subscriptions from across one of Europe\\u2019s largest coalfields, the new headquarters boasted a lavish 48-metre facade, a white marble staircase, a domed roof and splendid oak-panelled committee rooms. The crowning glory was a spectacular debating chamber, nicknamed the pitman\\u2019s parliament, in which each numbered seat corresponded to a colliery. Deliberately designed to resemble a mine-owner\\u2019s country estate, Redhills was a unique and extraordinary monument to working-class pride, ambition and self-organisation. Though the last Durham mine closed in 1993, a handful of officials still work in the building, organising a popular summer gala and looking after the welfare of retired miners. But while the gala still thrives as a cultural festival, the building itself is in a state of disrepair. Its future was looking grim, despite its Grade II-listed status. Then Ross Forbes, the association\\u2019s programme director, got a phone call. The National Lottery Heritage Fund had agreed an initial sum for a study on more than \\u00a34m of restoration and renovation work, with the aim of turning Redhills over to the people of Durham as a community and arts hub. The county council has chipped in with matched funding of \\u00a31.1m. A proletarian masterpiece is about to undergo a stunning, uplifting renaissance. \\u201cYou could say we\\u2019re happy chappies,\\u201d says Forbes, who has run a fundraising campaign for the past two years, with support from Grayson Perry and Emmerdale actress Charlie Hardwick, as well as 2,000 members of the public and the Victoria and Albert museum. \\u201cPeople have worked so hard for this. We made an application last year and we didn\\u2019t succeed. So it\\u2019s relief we feel, really. This will bring a vital part of working-class history back to life, and there is so much we can learn by doing that.\\u201d One of Forbes\\u2019s first jobs will be to venture into the basement where, he says, thousands of forgotten documents record the vibrant life and times of the coalfield. \\u201cThey have been buried there in the damp for decades but now we can get a team together, save them and archive them. This will be a treasure trove of social history. There will be everything from injury compensation records, which show what a dangerous life it was, to cold war pamphlets on how to spot communists in trade unions \\u2013 as well as stuff no one even knew was there.\\u201d There are hopes that the pitman\\u2019s parliament will resume its place as a forum for democratic debate. Citizens UK groups have already expressed interest in holding meetings in the chamber, which can accommodate up to 350 delegates. Films, concerts and shows will also help put Redhills back on the cultural map of the region. The intention, says Forbes, is that the restoration programme can be a catalyst for reflection on what working-class cultures achieved in the past and what can be done in the future. \\u201cIn a way the timing couldn\\u2019t be more appropriate,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a new political focus on the north and on the future of communities. \\u201cRedhills is a shining example of what people can collectively achieve. From here, the miners in effect created and ran their own welfare state in the first part of the 20th century. They built hospitals, homes, recreation halls. There was no state to do it for them so they did it for themselves and that was a tremendous source of pride and satisfaction. \\u201cPreserving the memory of where we have come from can help us work out where we should be going \\u2013 and this place can be at the heart of that debate.\\u201d In his book The Pitmen\\u2019s Requiem, an acclaimed chronicle of a mining village, author Peter Crookston movingly describes the faded glory of Redhills. Written 10 years ago, his account is beautiful but sad: \\u201cThe marble-floored lobby no longer resounds to the clatter of delegate\\u2019s studded brogues. Arguments in pitmatic [a local miners\\u2019 dialect] no longer thunder along the solid oak rows of the Miners\\u2019 Hall, where each colliery lodge has its own numbered seats.\\u201d The miners will never come back. But others are now certain to take their place as a new chapter in the illustrious history of Redhills begins. Manchester Mechanics Institute The MMI was created in 1824 to offer part-time study facilities to working people, and moved to its Princess Street building in 1855. The Trades Union Congress, the Co-Operative Insurance Society and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology were all founded in this building. The Lancashire and Cheshire Miners\\u2019 Convalescent Home Built between 1925 and 1927 in Blackpool, the home was opened by Edward, Prince of Wales, and is a Grade II-listed building. It was turned into flats in 2005.

The former prime minister told CNN\\u2019s Fareed Zakaria: \\u201cWhen I hear the rhetoric around Bernie Sanders, who by the way is obviously a very capable guy, it\\u2019s eerily familiar to anyone who\\u2019s just watched the debacle unfold in the British Labour party and our election defeat in the UK which is essentially the worst in our 120-year history.\\u201d In December, in an election primarily centered on Britain\\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, Corbyn\\u2019s Labour Party was beaten heavily by Boris Johnson\\u2019s Conservatives. Reaction to Blair\\u2019s comments on social media was swift, with many pointing out that Sanders\\u2019 signature policy \\u2013 universal healthcare \\u2013 has been a feature of life in Britain since the setting up of the publicly funded National Health Service in 1948. Critics also point out that the British left gained support after Blair began introducing limited privatisation into the NHS. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, surged in the early stages of the Democratic primary and was a clear frontrunner after the Nevada caucuses in February. But Joe Biden has mounted a stunning comeback, dominating the Super Tuesday primaries and subsequent contests. Amid the growing chaos of the coronavirus outbreak and Trump\\u2019s attempts to contain it, the senator and the former vice-president will debate behind closed doors in Washington on Sunday night. The next votes will be held in Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois on Tuesday. A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed Biden way ahead with Democratic voters and performing better than Sanders in a notional race against Trump. But the Vermont senator has said he will not drop out, aiming instead to shape the ideological outlook of the party on issues such as healthcare, student debt and the minimum wage and perhaps to surge back into contention should Biden stumble or fall. Like establishment figures and moderates in Democratic ranks, Blair doubts the wisdom of that decision. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s an appetite for socialist revolution,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t in Britain, I\\u2019d be surprised if there was in the US. And so I think \\u2026 if they go down that path it\\u2019s an enormous gamble. \\u201cPut it like this: you\\u2019re essentially saying, \\u2018Put aside the middle ground, we\\u2019re not really going to try to reach that, instead we\\u2019re going to up the turnout and that\\u2019s exactly the strategy of Corbyn\\u2019s Labour party in the UK and it failed, drastically.\\u201d Biden has attracted moderates, independents, suburban voters and a huge percentage of African Americans, many seemingly motivated to simply choose the candidate most likely to beat Trump in November. Sanders has done well among the young but hopes of a surge in turnout from such voters have not borne fruit. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I\\u2019m a skeptic about him,\\u201d Blair said. \\u201cNow on the other hand I think what is important to recognise is that progressive politics has got two big challenges. \\u201cFirst of all, my view of the populism is you\\u2019ve got to be very careful when you\\u2019re from the liberal or progressive side of politics, because if you\\u2019re not careful you tend to say that, \\u2018These people who are voting for Donald Trump or Brexit, they\\u2019re just irrational people, I don\\u2019t understand why they\\u2019re doing it and you\\u2019ve just got to hope this is a moment that passes.\\u2019 \\u201cNo, they\\u2019re doing it for reasons, and whereas populism can exploit grievances they don\\u2019t invent them. The grievances are real.\\u201d Blair said he knew Biden well and thought him \\u201chighly capable and decent\\u201d, but said the challenge if he did win the White House would be to effect real change while in office. Blair also said he was \\u201ca passionate believer that if the left goes down the path of trying to fight a culture war with the right, it will lose comprehensively and it really should not do that.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 683}, {\"title\": \"Coronavirus: UK manufacturers urged to consider switching to making ventilators\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-uk-manufacturers-urged-to-consider-switching-to-making-ventilators\", \"content\": \"Matt Hancock has called on British manufacturers to consider switching parts of their production to the making of medical ventilators needed to treat rising numbers of coronavirus patients.

Rolls-Royce, JCB and Unipart were all expected to speak to the prime minister on a conference call, according to a report in the Sunday Telegraph. The JCB chairman, Lord Bamford, said: \\u201cWe have been approached by the prime minister to see if we can help with the production of ventilators. We have research and engineering teams actively looking at the request at the moment.

We\\u2019re pleased to be involved in such an important project and doing everything we can to help.\\u201d According to ITV\\u2019s Robert Peston, Rolls-Royce had not been approached by the government. Peston tweeted: \\u201cI just spoke to Warren East, the chief executive of Rolls-Royce, one of the UK\\u2019s most advanced engineering companies. And he says government has not contacted him yet to discuss whether his or his suppliers\\u2019 facilities can be repurposed to make the many thousands of respirators.\\u201d Roll-Royce did not reject the possibility that its production could partially switch to the manufacturing of ventilation equipment. A spokesperson said: \\u201cWe understand that the government is exploring ways in which businesses can help deal with the outbreak of Covid-19. As they shape their plans, we are keen to do whatever we can to help the government and the country at this time and will look to provide any practical help we can.\\u201d When Marr questioned the usefulness of new ventilators without extra specialist medical staff, Hancock said: \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got the number of doctors that we have, we want to bring people who are recently retired back into service and, for instance, release doctors from some other duties and get them back into the health service.\\u201d Hancock said the NHS would be stopping other activities including elective or non-urgent surgeries. He said there was \\u201ca massive effort going on\\u201d to make sure the necessary staff and equipment was in place to tackle the outbreak effectively. Dr Rinesh Parmar, chair of the Doctors\\u2019 Association UK and an intensive care doctor, applauded the health secretary\\u2019s remarks on the procurement of extra ventilation equipment and additional beds, but said that without more specialist staff such efforts would be \\u201cpointless\\u201d. \\u201cThis announcement will be welcomed by doctors across the country who have been shouting from the rooftops about the lack of intensive care resources,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhilst NHS hospitals make emergency plans to create ITU [intensive treatment unit] beds and the government purchases more ventilators, the elephant in the room is the lack of highly trained intensive care nurses and doctors. The NHS faces this pandemic on a background of severe understaffing with almost 43,000 nurse and 10,000 doctor vacancies. It is pointless acquiring new ventilators without enough highly trained staff to operate them.\\u201d Parmar added that the purchasing of extra capacity in private hospitals may solve the issue of a lack of physical space in the NHS, but said there were \\u201cvery few\\u201d intensive care beds in private hospitals in the UK. \\u201cThe systematic under-resourcing of the NHS and exodus of staff that the government has presided over has ultimately left the country with a severe lack of specialist intensive care nurses and doctors,\\u201d he said. The UK ranks 24 out of 31 in comparison with other European nations in terms of the number of critical care beds available per 100,000 inhabitants. Doctors and hospital trusts have revealed that millions of patients will have care delayed as hospitals cancel non-urgent operations, including some surgery for people with heart and lung conditions. Other countries in Europe are also racing to buy or produce more ventilators, with Italy already facing such a dramatic shortage that patients with the best survival chances are being prioritised.

Coronavirus? The 31-year-old shook her head. \\u201cI see how people don\\u2019t wash their hands when they leave the bathroom. That grosses me out,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI think coronavirus is being blown out of proportion. It\\u2019s just like any other flu. It\\u2019s attacking the elders and people that have other health issues going on. It\\u2019s taking an impact on them versus the healthy 30-year-olds that takes care of themselves.\\u201d Rosio is not alone in rural northern Wisconsin, in her view that too much fuss is being made about the global pandemic that is creeping ever closer, even as the president declared a state of emergency. \\u201cI\\u2019m a little bit bothered because my dad is not one to go to the doctor and my grandpa, he\\u2019s going through chemo right now,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t shake hands with people. I work in human resources so when I do interviews I do the elbow bump. But I think some people are making too much of it. I guess we\\u2019ll see what happens.\\u201d What might be regarded as admirable calm or reckless nonchalance appears to be reflected among some local officials. Wisconsin has 19 confirmed coronavirus cases, up from just one a week ago. The governor has declared a health emergency and ordered the closure of all schools. But in Forest county, on Wisconsin\\u2019s northern border, the health department makes no mention of the virus on its website and has no notices at its offices. Its most recent public health alert is for eastern equine encephalitis and the front of its website features an appeal for drivers to take drinkers home from bars in order to cut road deaths. On Friday, the staff said the health director was having the day off and preparing to go away for the weekend. The office of the mayor of Crandon, the Forest county seat of about 1,900 people, said he was in Florida for two weeks. There was a time when towns such as Crandon might have sealed themselves off from the rest of the US, as some did during the flu epidemic a century ago, but these days the threat of contagion is perhaps less from outsiders arriving than residents bringing the virus back after travelling to work or shop. Many shop at a Walmart, about half an hour\\u2019s drive away in Rhinelander, which draws customers from far and wide. There was little sign of panic buying beyond the absence of hand sanitiser and an entire aisle of empty metal shelves where the toilet paper used to be. Peggy Osterman took a picture of it to send to her children with the message: \\u201cLook, this is crazy.\\u201d Osterman, 63, picked up a carton of sanitising wipes from the shelves opposite. Was this a sign she was worried about contracting the virus? \\u201cNo! They\\u2019re having really cheap flights right now and so I\\u2019m thinking, what the heck, I might just go some place. Somebody told me Hawaii was $400. I\\u2019m not worried one bit,\\u201d she said. Osterman said she planned to use the wipes to clean the seat on the plane. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s any worse than the flu. I fault our government because I think they were not on the ball and they should just have said: \\u2018Hey people, don\\u2019t worry.\\u2019 But I think the media pushed and pushed and got people panicking. It\\u2019s the flu. People who are dying are people who are older, who are sick. Which is sad.\\u201d As for the absence of toilet paper, Osterman puts that down less to people preparing for self-isolation than a fear that it comes from China and will run out. \\u201cI work in a dental office right now and we can\\u2019t get supplies,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t get floss, we can only order so many masks and so many gloves because everybody\\u2019s taking it. People are just panicking a little more than they should.\\u201d Crandon\\u2019s medical facilities are limited to a primary care clinic and so patients in need of more serious medical treatment have to go to hospital in Rhinelander. A doctor, who declined to be named because the hospital group he works for had not given him authorisation to speak, said he was concerned at apparent indifference among a lot of people in the area and blamed the Trump administration and sections of conservative media for downplaying the risk. \\u201cThere\\u2019s not sufficient consciousness of social distancing because that\\u2019s not the message people are getting from the top,\\u201d he said. The doctor also questioned whether health facilities in rural Wisconsin will be able to cope with a sudden increase in infections, with most lacking sufficient test kits and respirators for more than a small number of patients. \\u201cThe systems in this country are not well prepared for this sort of public health emergency,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t work well together.

As the voting booths closed, it was estimated that the rate of abstention may have reached up to 56% in ballots to elect local mayors and councillors \\u2013 traditionally more popular that national representatives. Election observers described the abstention rate as historic, while accepting the exceptional circumstances of the vote. Figures announced after the polling stations closed were that 120 people had died from the coronavirus in France, a rise of 29 in 24 hours. There are 5,400 confirmed cases in the country. Around 47 million people were called to vote in the first round of the election; the low turnout raised questions about whether the second round would \\u2013 or could \\u2013 take place next Sunday. The government is expected to make a decision on Tuesday. Anne Hidalgo, the socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, won the first round of municipal elections on Sunday, polling just over 30% of the votes \\u2013 well ahead of her closest rival, Rachida Dati, from the mainstream rightwing Les R\\u00e9publicains. The government-backed candidate, Agn\\u00e8s Buzyn, from the president\\u2019s centrist LREM party, came in third. All three go through to the second round, along with the Europe Ecology-Greens candidate. Polling stations opened at 8am on Sunday and within hours it was clear participation would be low. Hours earlier, the prime minister, \\u00c9douard Philippe, announced the closure of all non-essential shops and businesses, including museums, restaurants and cinemas until 15 April. The official decree authorising the shutdown was published on Sunday. It also covered conference and meeting rooms, shopping centres, libraries and archives, dance halls and discos, exhibitions and sports halls. Bars and restaurants can continue offering a takeaway or delivery service.

He added: \\u201cWe are heading towards a general epidemic in the very next few days, but everything depends on the behaviour of the virus and above all people\\u2019s respect for barrier measures.

The opening, on 4 April, will mark the climax of a 20-year project to celebrate stories in all their forms in Oxford. Although the city has a rich literary heritage as the home of famous children\\u2019s authors such as Pullman, Lewis Carroll, CS Lewis, JRR Tolkien, Diana Wynne Jones and Katherine Rundell, Oxford has high levels of child illiteracy and was the lowest-ranked district in the country for reading and writing in 2010. \\u201cAll the various projects we\\u2019ve done over the years have shown the impact we can have,\\u201d said the museum\\u2019s founder, Kim Pickin. \\u201cWe can help children to get more interested in stories and motivated to read.

It also offers inviting spaces for live storytelling session by speciallytrained guides as well as by the children and their family members. \\u201cWhen you see an adult and a child curled up on our giant bed with a book and cuddly toys related to the story, you know they\\u2019re having a very special moment together,\\u201d said Pickin, adding that inspiring parents and children to connect other through stories is part of the museum\\u2019s mission. \\u201cWe\\u2019re very keen to turn our visitors into storytellers in some form or other while they\\u2019re here.\\u201d As well as a fun day out that triggers \\u201cfeelings of wonder and delight\\u201d in readers of all ages, she hopes the museum will help transform the way digital-savvy children perceive stories and books. \\u201cWe hope people will discover that stories are important and very rich and varied, and that it\\u2019s great to grow up with a range of stories in different forms and from different places and times.\\u201d She is critical of the government\\u2019s approach to children\\u2019s literature in schools. \\u201cThere are really inspiring teachers out there, but they\\u2019re pushed for time and resources, and school library budgets are being cut.\\u201d Her co-director, Caroline Jones, is also concerned: \\u201cWhen you think about what teachers face on a day-to-day basis, the thing that is most easily engineered out of the classroom experience is any notion of imagination or creativity.

The set was modest and sparse, and the costumes humble, whether you were a member of the ruling class of black Crosses or one of the subordinate white Noughts. All that stood out were the actors\\u2019 faces, as though the production intended to draw attention to race above all else. But Noughts + Crosses isn\\u2019t about race \\u2013 the idea that skin colourdoes and should carry social consequences. It\\u2019s about racism \\u2013 the system of power that allows a demonstrably false myth like race to govern reality. Landing almost 20 years after the book was first published, the BBC adaptation understands this nuance and exposes power in every shot. African statues rise up among skyscrapers, black faces adorn billboard adverts and white household staff wear dowdy versions of typically vivid African prints \\u2013 all of which renders Noughts and their culture invisible and powerless. Even acts of kindness are poisoned by inequality; Sephy is magnanimous when she orders a guard to allow parents of a child hospitalised by police brutality to sit by his bedside, but she\\u2019s only able to do this because she\\u2019s a member of the ruling race, making an act of well-meaning graciousness feel deeply uncomfortable. Episode one is a meticulous study of power and how it manifests through culture, institutions and relationships. The modern retelling is also precise in who it names as wielders of power. The Crosses we get to know are wealthy, connected ones. They are politicians with children who are educated at elite institutions that demand loyalty to the oppressive status quo (even the few Noughts who enter the Sandhurst-esque Mercy Point military school are challenged on their loyalty to Cross supremacy). Crosses aren\\u2019t all wealthy \\u2013 there would be no need for a poster warning against interracial hand-holding on the bus if only Noughts used public transport \\u2013 but the focus on Crosses with cultural, political and economic capital reminds us that, when it comes to perpetuating racism as a system of power, it\\u2019s really only those at the top within the dominant racial group who are in the driving seat. Noughts + Crosses reveals a world where a white underclass is in conflict with a specific subset of ruling black people. This is in stark contrast with the real world, not just because it is whiteness that dominates in reality, but because we discuss racism in a much clumsier way. We flatten diverse experiences into identity buzzwords such as \\u201cBAME\\u201d. White working-class people (\\u201caverage Brits\\u201d, \\u201ctraditional Labour voters\\u201d) are told they are being attacked when people of colour criticise institutions and practices that are often just as classist as they are racist. The right insists we have a debate on race realism \\u2013 the idea that there are meaningful genetic differences between races \\u2013 as though the idea wasn\\u2019t debunked decades ago by the scientific community (and debunked by reality much earlier still). And when working-class white boys do badly in education they\\u2019re compared with black boys who are scarcely an inch ahead, rather than the economically privileged white boys \\u2013 making clear who our society believes is in competition, poor people whatever their race \\u2013 and what is considered the acceptable natural order of things, a ruling white elite. Because it inverts the racial totem pole, Noughts + Crosses\\u2019 visual language is alien to most British viewers \\u2013 the prime minister, Opal Folami, leading a cabinet in recognisably African clothes is an unfamiliar sight to a country that has had only white prime ministers and politicians of colour who wear predominantly western clothes. Victimised Noughts, however, feel very familiar; while the black cultural domination required for the former to take place in the real UK is just a myth put about by nervous racists, our reality does produce marginalised white people like those in Albion, even if they aren\\u2019t marginalised because of their race. There are differences in how black and poorer white people experience oppression, and Noughts + Crosses is full of allusions to the specific realities of being a racialised minority \\u2013 dark plasters on pink skin is just the start. But by building a whole world on the logic of African supremacy, and showing how it produces conditions for white people that are so similar to poor white people in the real world, Noughts + Crosses posits that, not only is race a myth, but a society based on believing in racial supremacy inevitably produces marginalised white people, no matter what culture is dominant. What\\u2019s more, it highlights the challenges that working-class white people and people of colour share in the real world. Noughts + Crosses was partly inspired by Stephen Lawrence\\u2019s murder and how it was handled by a racist police force, but it\\u2019s worth remembering that just four years before he died, police classism inflicted misery on the families of Hillsborough victims. That\\u2019s the message viewers should take from this series, not that it\\u2019s \\u201canti-white\\u201d as some have claimed.

The US president had offered the T\\u00fcbingen-based biopharmaceutical company CureVac \\u201clarge sums of money\\u201d to gain exclusive access to their work, wrote Die Welt. According to an anonymous source quoted in the newspaper, Trump was doing everything to secure a vaccine against the coronavirus for the US, \\u201cbut for the US only\\u201d.

At the start of the month, Menichella was invited to the White House in Washington to discuss strategy for the rapid development and production of a coronavirus vaccine with Trump, the vice-president, Mike Pence, and members of the White House coronavirus task force.

All three Labour leadership candidates demanded greater clarity, and Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\\u2019s first minister, also spoke out as her officials sought to clarify a warning from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, about the over-70s having to self-isolate at home for up to four months. The opposition parties have largely been supportive of the government\\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, but there have been at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting has been based on unattributable sources. Keir Starmer, the Labour leadership race frontrunner, said that over the last 48 hours ministers had been \\u201cfailing in their responsibilities to provide consistent and transparent public health advice\\u201d and that allowing the public to learn about significant changes in policy through anonymous briefings was \\u201cirresponsible\\u201d. \\u201cIt\\u2019s time the government commits to a daily press conference about its handling of coronavirus. This must be hosted by a government minister or the prime minister himself, with experts and advisers available to answer questions as appropriate,\\u201d Starmer said. Rebecca Long-Bailey also called for daily briefings to be broadcast, and Lisa Nandy said the government had to publish much better information because the last 48 hours had been \\u201ca real shambles\\u201d. Nandy singled out as an example Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\\u2019s chief scientific adviser, giving an interview on Friday morning defending the decision not to ban large sporting events only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented. In his interview, Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d to coronavirus, echoing an argument used by another adviser and the head of government\\u2019s behavioural insights team, Dr David Halpern, earlier in the week. Vallance\\u2019s comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday, Hancock had to distance himself from Vallance, saying \\u201cherd immunity is not our goal or policy\\u201d. The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to \\u201cstay self-isolated\\u201d at home for four months, but his use of the term \\u201cself-isolate\\u201d was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether. Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\\u2019s chief medical officer, told the BBC that what was being proposed for elderly people was \\u201creducing social contact, rather than self-isolating\\u201d and that it was \\u201cscaremongering\\u201d to suggest they would be told to sit \\u201chome alone\\u201d. When Jason Leitch, the Scottish government\\u2019s national clinical director, posted a message on Twitter making the same point, Sturgeon commended him for providing \\u201cimportant clarity\\u201d. Sturgeon went on to add in another tweet: \\u201cGiving clear and consistent information to public at the right time on coronavirus is vital.

Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making. Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens \\u2013 household names in America \\u2013 will provide \\u201cdrive-thru\\u201d testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance. This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing. The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump\\u2019s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller\\u2019s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\\u2019s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk. The acid test of Trump\\u2019s maverick leadership has finally come.

His discomfort on this topic was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it. \\u201cWell, I just think it\\u2019s a nasty question,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know anything about it.\\u201d Trump\\u2019s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \\u201cI don\\u2019t take responsibility at all.\\u201d The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention. Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \\u201cKeep America Great Again\\u201d cap, boasting of his \\u201cnatural ability\\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one. On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers\\u2019 estimation, an unmitigated disaster, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct. Then came Friday\\u2019s rose garden reset. Trump declared a national emergency that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available. His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative. \\u201cThis day should be an inspiration to every American,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbecause thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we\\u2019re bringing an all-of-America approach. \\u201cMr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China \\u2026 throughout this process, Mr President, you\\u2019ve put the health of America first.\\u201d It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work? There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points \\u2013 its biggest point gain ever. Furthermore, the are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump\\u2019s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, said: \\u201cI think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China]. The rollout of the kits and the testing was a step backwards but now they seem to be getting their footing back.\\u201d Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: \\u201cHe gets mixed reviews. His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk. Where he got good reviews lies in the government\\u2019s overall approach.\\u201d Whalen noted that California\\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship. Newsom told reporters: \\u201cWe had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: \\u2018We\\u2019re gonna do the right thing\\u2019 and \\u2018You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise\\u2019. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.\\u201d Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November\\u2019s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting. It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush\\u2019s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Whalen said: \\u201cThe question is how does he handle this as on a personal level. For Bush, the problem with Katrina wasn\\u2019t the federal response but Bush not getting out of the plane, not showing the personal touch. Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he\\u2019d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief. \\u201cThe economy is his trump card at all times.

With Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge inadvertently helped invent an entire genre \\u2013 industrial music, its name taken from the band\\u2019s Industrial record label \\u2013 which, over the years, developed and mutated from a misunderstood and frequently reviled cult into a platinum-selling concern. Intent on, as one writer put it, \\u201cbursting open the blistered lie [that] rock and roll culture was telling about rebellion and transgression\\u201d, virtually every one of Throbbing Gristle\\u2019s radical, confrontational ideas was gradually subsumed into something approaching the mainstream. Electronic producers queued up to pay homage to the band, whose resident technical wizard Chris Carter may or may not have invented the first sampler by dismantling a series of cassette recorders and linking them to bandmate Peter Christopherson\\u2019s keyboard: Detroit techno pioneer Carl Craig named a 1991 EP Four Jazz Funk Classics in homage to TG\\u2019s 1979 album 20 Jazz Funk Greats. Twenty years after they caused disquiet by writing songs about serial killers and toying with quasi-Nazi imagery, one of the biggest rock stars in the world was called Marilyn Manson: on his Antichrist Superstar tour, performed in front of a huge logo that looked remarkably similar to TG\\u2019s trademark thunderflash, with its echoes both of high-voltage warning signs and, more queasily, the symbol of the British Union of Fascists. If P-Orridge\\u2019s later work with Psychic TV is less celebrated, it nevertheless demonstrated h/er uncanny ability to think ahead of the curve, presaging everything from acid house to the ongoing conversation about gender fluidity. P-Orridge formed h/er first band, Worm, when s/he was still Neil Megson, a Manchester-born pupil at Solihull Public School. Worm even recorded an album, pressing up a solitary copy in 1968. If nothing else, it revealed that P-Orridge\\u2019s approach to music was defiantly left-field from the start: noise, improvisations and tape experiments mixed with songs that sounded a little like a less adept, more chaotic version of psychedelic folkies the Incredible String Band. When s/he moved to Hull, adopted the pseudonym Genesis P-Orridge and set up performance art group Coum with h/er partner, Christine Newby, who was re-christened Cosey Fanni Tutti, they too were initially music-based, albeit in the widest sense of the phrase. They performed chaotic, tuneless, unrehearsed gigs, including one supporting Hawkwind where they chanted \\u201coff off off\\u201d from the stage to prefigure the audience\\u2019s inevitable response. Despite the enthusiasm of DJ John Peel, who plugged the band in his Disc and Music Echo column, Coum\\u2019s interest in music seemed to wane as h/er art became less playful and more disturbing: from brightly costumed actions on the streets of Hull that occasionally attracted crowds of entranced children, h/er performances shifted and began involving live sex acts, violence and much spilling of bodily fluids. It wasn\\u2019t until P-Orridge and Tutti met former sound engineer Chris Carter that they were able to make music that reflected Coum\\u2019s bleak latterday vision, while enabling them to break out of an art world they increasingly derided as sterile and elitist. With Peter \\u201cSleazy\\u201d Christopherson \\u2013 a photographer and record sleeve designer who had taken part in some of Coum\\u2019s later performances \\u2013 on keyboards, the early Throbbing Gristle dealt in churning noise, punishing electronic rhythms and distorted vocals that dealt with a variety of distressing topics: the Moors Murders, the Nazi holocaust, the acts of mutilation and barbarism described in Slug Bait. They started playing gigs, to a largely apoplectic response: shows at regular rock venues frequently degenerated into violent confrontations with the audience. They performed at London\\u2019s ICA as part of the Coum retrospective exhibition Prostitution, which provoked such outrage that questions were asked in Parliament \\u2013 Tory MP Nicholas Fairbairn provided Throbbing Gristle with their lasting epigraph by describing them as \\u201cwreckers of civilisation\\u201d \\u2013 and the venue\\u2019s Arts Council funding was cut. Perhaps understandably, the band did not expect their murky, lo-fi, self-released debut album Second Annual Report to be a success: if it wasn\\u2019t entirely without precedent \\u2013 you could hear in it echoes of Yoko Ono and John Lennon\\u2019s experimental work, the German avant-garde rock bands of the early 70s, the Velvet Underground circa White Light/White Heat and Lou Reed\\u2019s notorious Metal Machine Music \\u2013 it was nevertheless incredibly extreme for its era. But not only did its initial pressing of 750 copies sell out, it seemed to act as a lightning rod for other artists who had coincidentally been thinking along similar musical lines, many of whom ended up being released by Industrial: Sheffield\\u2019s Cabaret Voltaire and Clock DVA, Australia\\u2019s SPK and Germany\\u2019s Leather Nun. Throbbing Gristle proved to be a more expansive and diverse band than the unsettling din of Second Annual Report suggested. They followed it up with United, an alternately creepy and oddly sweet-sounding electronic single that foreshadowed the synth-led direction that mainstream pop would take in the early 80s: their subsequent albums took in everything from experiments with dark ambience, warped pop songs, audio collages and tracks that now sound remarkably like techno five years too early, while continually picking away at unpleasant subject matter. At its best, their work had a startling originality and power: 42 years after it first appeared on 1978\\u2019s DOA: The Third and Final Report, Hamburger Lady\\u2019s eerie, hushed retelling of the plight of a burns victim remains a genuinely terrifying piece of music. Throbbing Gristle were never going to be anything other than divisive, as evidenced by the contemporary critical reaction, but they developed an increasingly fanatical cult following, with Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis among their ranks. Some of TG\\u2019s members professed to be horrified by their popularity \\u2013 \\u201cI don\\u2019t like acceptance, I distrust it completely,\\u201d said Tutti \\u2013 but P-Orridge set about moulding their fanbase into a quasi-paramilitary cult. S/he began referring to their gigs as \\u201crallies\\u201d and sending out literature asking: \\u201cDo you want to become a fully-equipped Terror Guard? Ready for action? NOTHING SHORT OF A TOTAL WAR\\u201d; their 1981 single Discipline bore the legend \\u201cmarching music for psychic youth\\u201d. By the time of their rancorous split, shortly after Discipline\\u2019s release, there was a burgeoning underground scene of new artists exploring similar musical and thematic areas: Current 93, Whitehouse, Nurse With Wound, Foetus, Test Department. Some were TG acolytes, some professed to loathe them and have no connection to their work: either way, it was impossible to see how said scene could have existed had Throbbing Gristle not existed first. P-Orridge formed Psychic TV with, among others, Christopherson and his partner John Balance. They unexpectedly signed to a major label; more unexpected still, their 1982 debut album, Force the Hand of Chance, was frequently lush, melodic and strangely romantic. Its sleeve, however, bore the words: \\u201cFile under: fundraising activities\\u201d. P-Orridge viewed Psychic TV as the musical wing of Thee Temple Ov Psychic Youth, which, depending on your perspective, was either an organisation dedicated to disseminating information about magickal practices \\u2013 some derived from Aleister Crowley, others from occultist Austin Osman Spare \\u2013 a satire on organised religion, or something approaching a cult, with P-Orridge its leader. The latter was an accusation frequently levelled by ex-members of Psychic TV, including Christopherson and Balance, who left after 1983\\u2019s alternately cinematic and chilling Dreams Less Sweet to concentrate on their own project, the hugely acclaimed Coil. Their departure set the tone for a certain turbulence among Psychic TV\\u2019s personnel: P-Orridge never failed to attract interesting collaborators \\u2013 there\\u2019s a credible argument that his greatest talent lay as a catalyst \\u2013 but members perpetually came and left, frequently in acrimony, occasionally claiming that P-Orridge had taken credit for their work or ripped them off financially. Psychic TV\\u2019s subsequent releases were never quite as musically compelling, although you couldn\\u2019t fault their eclecticism, nor P-Orridge\\u2019s willingness to spring surprises on his audience. Perhaps the biggest shock came when Psychic TV reinvented themselves as a relatively straightforward psychedelic rock band \\u2013 P-Orridge having presumably decided that rock and roll wasn\\u2019t for arselickers as long as he was doing it \\u2013 with decidedly mixed results: their cover of the Beach Boys\\u2019 Good Vibrations was an impressive act of chutzpah given P-Orridge\\u2019s limited vocal ability, though they grazed the lower reaches of the charts with Godstar, a charming and remarkably catchy paean to late Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones. They then shifted into acid house, or at least something like it: an enthusiastic consumer of hallucinogens, P-Orridge had heard the term, but none of the music. P-Orridge devotees are fond of making lofty claims for the results \\u2013 initially released as a fake compilation album, Jack the Tab \\u2013 but in truth \\u201cthe first British acid house album\\u201d betrays its origins: a hastily thrown-together cocktail of electronic beats and samples from 60s exploitation movies, it patently wasn\\u2019t going to give any of acid house\\u2019s actual progenitors sleepless nights. Never popular with British clubbers or DJs, Psychic TV\\u2019s subsequent acid house albums \\u2013 Towards Thee Infinite Beat and the remix collection Beyond Thee Infinite Beat \\u2013 fared better in the US: the band played raves in California and looked at one stage to have secured a major label deal. The latter fell through, but by then P-Orridge had bigger problems: falsely accused of ritual Satanic abuse in a bizarre 1992 Channel 4 documentary made by a Christian fundamentalist group, s/he went into self-imposed exile in the US. Initially, s/he continued releasing albums as Psychic TV \\u2013 the electronic collages of the Electric Newspaper series, the return to psychedelic rock of 1996\\u2019s Trip Reset \\u2013 but seemed to be gradually losing interest in music: h/er next project, Thee Majesty, featured P-Orridge reading and improvising poetry over experimental soundscapes. S/he reactivated the Psychic TV name in 2003 \\u2013 an all-new line-up featuring h/er second wife, Jacqueline Breyer, with whom P-Orridge embarked on the \\u201cpandrogeny project\\u201d, involving gender neutrality and body modification to look more like each other. Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs contributed to the 2006 album, Hell Is Invisible, Heaven Is Her/e, but more attention was attracted by the reunion of Throbbing Gristle. The latter came as a considerable surprise: relations between the former members were famously strained, a state of affairs not much helped by Psychic TV playing a 1988 London gig as Throbbing Gristle Ltd, ostensibly to demonstrate that P-Orridge was the sole creative force behind the band and the others were, in his words, \\u201cdishonest parasitic bastards\\u201d. As it turned out, the reunion was as tempestuous as Throbbing Gristle\\u2019s initial incarnation. They played a series of acclaimed live shows and released a handful of interesting albums, but Cosey Fanni Tutti\\u2019s 2017 autobiography Art Sex Music depicted the reformed band in a state of almost perpetual conflict, with P-Orridge invariably at odds with the other members before suddenly quitting. P-Orridge subsequently attempted to halt the release of Desertshore, a cover of Nico\\u2019s 1968 album recorded by Tutti, Carter and a series of guest vocalists as a tribute to Peter Christopherson, who died in 2010. Certainly, the album and an accompanying collection of improvisations recorded after h/er departure didn\\u2019t do much for P-Orridge\\u2019s assertion s/he was the band\\u2019s sole creative force: they were significantly better than anything the reformed TG had released while s/he was a member. These were far from the most damaging claims made in Tutti\\u2019s harrowing memoir, which not only depicted P-Orridge as mentally and physically abusive and given to claiming authorship of others\\u2019 work, but baldly accused h/er of attempted murder: first attacking her with a knife, then throwing a breeze block at her from a balcony, narrowly missing her head. P-Orridge blithely dismissed the claims, which seemed to have little impact on h/er standing as a revered cult figure, partly because Tutti\\u2019s book wasn\\u2019t published in the US, where P-Orridge was permanently based: either those devotees who did read it chose not to believe what it said, or felt that s/he had spent so long engaged in transgressive activities that a further set of transgressions didn\\u2019t matter. Or perhaps they felt Genesis P-Orridge\\u2019s artistic achievements were so monumental that such revelations couldn\\u2019t impact on them. Whether history will posthumously agree remains to be seen: that Genesis P-Orridge played a role in changing the course of rock music, however, is beyond doubt.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 2071}, {\"title\": \"Never read Middlemarch or listened to Wagner\\u2019s Ring cycle?

His speech that night was hardly different from the hundreds of speeches he had made before \\u2013 and all the speeches he would make after. But he looked different. Famously irascible, Sanders smiled deeply and laughed easily. The future of his political revolution was as bright and clear as the big Texas sky. \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell anybody. I don\\u2019t wanna get them nervous,\\u201d the 78-year-old democratic socialist boasted, dropping his voice as if sharing a secret. \\u201cWe are gonna win the Democratic primary in Texas.\\u201d But the next 10 days would wipe away every trace of that optimism. Sanders not only lost Texas but a string of other contests that stripped him of his briefly held status as frontrunner, returning him to a more familiar role: long-shot insurgent chasing the establishment favorite. In frank but defiant remarks on Wednesday, Sanders acknowledged that he was \\u201closing\\u201d to Joe Biden after a stunning reversal of fortune. Biden, snatched only days before from the jaws of defeat, had just racked up four more victories, including in Michigan, a state that revived Sanders\\u2019 presidential bid four years ago and where he had pinned his hopes of a comeback. Later that evening, Sanders folded himself into an armchair on the set of NBC\\u2019s The Tonight Show in New York City. \\u201cHow you feeling?\\u201d host Jimmy Fallon asked gingerly. \\u201cI\\u2019m feeling good,\\u201d Sanders sighed. \\u201cCould feel better.\\u201d *** Bernie Sanders had promised to build an unprecedented \\u201cmulti-generational, multi-racial coalition\\u201d of young people and working-class voters that would \\u201csweep this country\\u201d and transform American politics. \\u201cYou cannot beat Trump with the same old same old kind of politics,\\u201d he told supporters at a Super Tuesday rally in Vermont, where he had expected a celebration. But that night, voters in 10 of the 14 states holding primary contests disagreed, choosing instead a candidate who represents a return to the pre-Trump years. It was Biden, not Sanders, who expanded the Democratic electorate, bringing in non-voters and suburban voters while boosting turnout among African Americans. Sanders\\u2019 commanding support among Latinos helped him notch two consequential victories in Nevada and California. But his appeal among young people, liberals and politically independent voters was not enough to realize the revolution he envisioned. \\u201cBernie Sanders\\u2019 challenge always in the race was to expand his support,\\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a lead strategist on Sanders\\u2019 2016 team who split with the campaign early last year. \\u201cAnd he just never found a way electorally to attract voters outside of his coalition.\\u201d In the criticaldays between his victory in Nevada and Super Tuesday, Sanders continued to rail against old foes \\u2013 the Democratic establishment and the \\u201ccorporate media\\u201d \\u2013 instead of reaching out to the members of the party he hoped to lead. In a 60 Minutes interview the day after the caucuses, Sanders told host Anderson Cooper that he didn\\u2019t have an estimate for the total cost of his sweeping economic agenda. In the same interview, he reiterated past remarks that were complimentary of certain aspects of Fidel Castro\\u2019s communist government, sparking backlash among Democrats in the battleground state of Florida. \\u201cOne of Bernie\\u2019s strengths is his consistency \\u2013 he\\u2019s been delivering the same message to some degree since the 70s,\\u201d Longabaugh said. \\u201cBut it also inhibited him in the sense that it limited his potential for growth.\\u201d Sanders\\u2019 ascent set off panic among party officials and leaders. Swing-district Democrats warned Sanders would hurt their chances of re-election, while members of the Democratic National Committee plotted to stop him if he arrived at the convention shy of the delegates needed to win the nomination outright. \\u201cFrom the beginning, we knew this was going to be the fight of our lives,\\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \\u201cWe\\u2019re taking on not only the corporate elite of this party but the billionaire class, the pharmaceutical industry, the prison industrial complex, Wall Street, the insurance companies.\\u201d Even so, the rapid alignment behind Biden, first by his former rivals and then by millions of voters, caught the campaign off guard. In a matter of days, the field shrank from seven top contenders to just two. Moderates, once paralyzed over which candidate to support, suddenly rallied behind the former vice president. On the eve of Super Tuesday, Biden won the endorsements of three former opponents and more followed in a dramatic show of force that his team compared to the Avengers assembling. Notably, Elizabeth Warren, Sanders\\u2019 closest ideological ally, has not yet backed anyone. \\u201cIn candor, the consolidation of candidates behind Biden happened sooner than anyone expected \\u201d said congressman Ro Khanna, one of Sanders\\u2019 national co-chairs. \\u201cThere was simply not enough time to build more broadly.\\u201d *** Bernie Sanders entered the primary with more built-in advantages than any of his rivals. His name recognition was sky high, he had an enviable list of small-dollar donors, an unshakable base of support and the experience of having just run a presidential campaign. Little changed from 2016, not the message nor the mission, not even the \\u201cBernie\\u201d logo. It would be a \\u201cclass-conscious\\u201d campaign for people who felt left out of the political process. \\u201cHe represents the people who have been written off for much of their lives,\\u201d Khanna said. \\u201cFor the people who feel they haven\\u2019t been heard, who feel marginalized, who feel the system hasn\\u2019t been working for them, he is their voice.\\u201d A heart attack in October nearly derailed his presidential bid. With Warren on the march and Sanders slumping, his candidacy appeared to be in freefall. But his loyal troops rallied to his side. A strong debate performance and a coveted endorsement from congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez paved the way for a remarkable comeback. It proved to be a clarifying moment for the campaign. Sanders used the experience to connect more deeply with his supporters. At intimate town halls and on social media, his team elevated the economic struggles of people who couldn\\u2019t afford medical treatment or prescription drugs. It was the foundation of the campaign ethos, \\u201cNot me, us.\\u201d But political reality set in after voting began. Despite his successes in the first three contests, Sanders struggled in a fractured field to retain the support he garnered four years ago. After the centrist vote coalesced behind Biden, he lost state he had won in 2016, when he was far less of a political force than he is today. Democrats\\u2019 overriding priority in 2020 was to defeat Trump. And on that front, Sanders was losing to Biden. \\u201cI cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said \\u2013 and I quote \\u2013 \\u2018I like what your campaign stands for,\\u201d Sanders said soberly from his hometown of Burlington last week. \\u201c\\u2018I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I\\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\\u201d *** Black voters have decided the Democratic nominee in every primary election since 1992. And this year, as in 2016, African Americans overwhelmingly chose Sanders\\u2019 opponent. In South Carolina, black voters propelled Biden\\u2019s triumph and set in motion a turnaround that greatly narrowed the senator\\u2019s path to the nomination. Supporters believe that Sanders\\u2019 effort to make inroads with black voters over the past four years was obscured by Biden\\u2019s longstanding ties to African American communities and his eight years as Barack Obama\\u2019s loyal lieutenant. After being walloped in the south on Super Tuesday, Sanders\\u2019 campaign released an ad that featured Obama praising the senator and saying emphatically \\u201cFeel the Bern!\\u201d But it did not yield the results he hoped. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a fundamental disconnect if folks still don\\u2019t feel like he\\u2019s the one who they can put their faith in after four years,\\u201d said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund. Ahead of the Michigan primary, Sanders earned the endorsement of the Rev Jesse Jackson, in what those close to him said was a deeply meaningful moment. In 1988, Jackson became the first black presidential candidate to win millions of votes on a similar platform of universal healthcare, a federal jobs guarantee and taxing the rich. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was one of the few white public officials to endorse him. \\u201cThe ideas resonate with black folks,\\u201d Albright said. \\u201cMedicare for All, free college, debt forgiveness, criminal justice reform, on those issues black folks are far closer to Bernie than to Biden. So it\\u2019s not the ideas. It\\u2019s this issue of electability.\\u201d *** Sanders now faces a legacy-defining decision: does he stay in a race that has become increasingly difficult for him to win or does he bow out now to begin the delicate process of unifying the party? Many supporters are not ready to see Sanders exit. Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant and chairman of his political non-profit, Our Revolution, acknowledged the senator faces long odds but urged him to keep competing. Every delegate Sanders accumulates in the primary, he argued, will be \\u201ccritical to negotiations over the rules and party platform\\u201d at the convention in Milwaukee this summer. \\u201cIf he drops out now, those ideas are left with the delegates that he\\u2019s won,\\u201d Cohen said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re the voice for these issues.\\u201d Further complicating the course ahead is a new challenge: running for president in midst of a global health emergency. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Sanders to abandon the stadium-size rallies that are a feature of his campaign. \\u201cThis coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way and that\\u2019s hurting us,\\u201d he told reporters during a brief press conference in Burlington, where he has spent his time since cancelling an election night rally in Cleveland last week amid concerns about the virus. Yet the senator has signaled in recent days that he is unlikely to battle Biden to the bitter end. But he also made clear that there are issues on which he still intends to confront his opponent \\u2013 and on which has the leverage to do so. On Sunday Sanders will appear at the next presidential debate, a long-sought one-on-one with Biden. At a press conference, he previewed a litany of policy questions that he planned to press Biden on: \\u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\\u201d he intends to ask on issues from income inequality to student loan debt. When Sanders launched his campaign in February 2019, he was asked what would be different this time. \\u201cWe\\u2019re gonna win,\\u201d Sanders replied, with the blunt assurance that thrills so many of his supporters. By his own admission, he is falling short of that goal. As Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy, there is also the sense that he has already accomplished more than he could have imagined in his nearly 50-year political career. Michael Kazin, a historian and co-editor of Dissent magazine, said Sanders has already achieved what many nominees and presidents never do: he has fundamentally shifted the ideology of the Democratic party on everything from healthcare and climate change to raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich. Sanders, Kazin said, was likely the \\u201cmost leftwing candidate\\u201d to make it this far in American political history. That a 78-year-old democratic socialist has come within striking distance of the nomination is an \\u201castounding success\\u201d in its own right, marveled Bill Press, a progressive talkshow host who helped launch Sanders 2016 campaign from the living room of his Washington home. \\u201cIn a very real sense,\\u201d he said, \\u201cBernie has already won the primary.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 1955}, {\"title\": \"Mother's Day marketing is not what it used to be\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/15/eva-wiseman-column-mothers-day-marketing-presents-has-got-weird\", \"content\": \"Mother\\u2019s Day has got weird.

Of course these traditions have evolved \\u2013 I\\u2019ve been aware, as age has come, of the increasing number of afternoon tea deals and heavy marketing of heavy perfumes, neither of which offer much change from a hundred pound note.

A ping, an email: \\u201cThe case for buying your mum a vibrator \\u2013 New sex toy retailer offering 25% off Mother\\u2019s Day gifts.\\u201d I don\\u2019t think of myself as a prude, though yes, I can see the appeal. I can see the appeal of identifying as such, and so being free to ignore the sweaty sexualities of others, their glazed little eyes when somebody says \\u201cangina\\u201d. Prudishness has much going for it, but I am a modern woman, able to contemplate and acknowledge the private shadowlands of my fellow passengers\\u2019 evenings without judgment. But Christ, not my MUM. Lovely lady, but she is, always has been and must always remain sexless, thank you. It\\u2019s not appropriate to gift a vibrator to the woman whose genitalia one once emerged from. It\\u2019s not appropriate, and it\\u2019s not nice. Among the other mad and maddening suggestions for Mother\\u2019s Day ideas I\\u2019ve tripped up on this week were a list of \\u201cInstagram captions\\u201d to pay tribute to your mum, helpfully divided into \\u201cfunny\\u201d (\\u201cCheers to the woman who gave up wine for nine months, just for me\\u201d), \\u201ccute\\u201d, \\u201csong lyrics\\u201d and \\u201cquotes\\u201d (\\u201cA mother\\u2019s arms are more comforting than anyone else\\u2019s,\\u201d Princess Diana). The idea here being that a person can copy and paste her love from a pre-approved selection, only one typing finger necessary to @ literally the person who created her. I\\u2019m struggling to imagine something that requires less effort. Blinking, perhaps. Raising a buttock for a muted fart. More creative, yet just as baffling is the new scheme in Hull providing small thank-you cards for strangers to give to mothers they see breastfeeding in public. Again, weird. Why should a passerby be thankful a stranger was feeding their child? If the card came from the suckling kid hanging off her chafed tit on a cold March morning I could perhaps see the logic. Elsewhere, the Daily Mail has published a list of self-help books to give as Mother\\u2019s Day gifts, which, call me old-fashioned, I would very much take as a passive-aggressive snipe from an unappreciative whinger who\\u2019s neither paid me back for last year\\u2019s loan nor, clearly, is willing to listen to my advice on eyebrow plucking. And finally, in the window of Boots (which last year did a Mother\\u2019s Day promotion on \\u201cintimate feel\\u201d condoms, and has this year added a rack of Berocca to their seasonal display) a sign urging customers to celebrate Mother\\u2019s Day by purchasing \\u201cmenopause hero\\u201d products for them, including discreet bottles of Durex lube. Happy Mother\\u2019s Day Mummy, just a little something to help your boyfriend guide himself in more smoothly, Xx. Could the new Mother\\u2019s Day marketing have been inspired by the campaigns around International Women\\u2019s Day, which fell with a pinkish clank a fortnight earlier? It is certainly familiar, this soggy combination of commodified female pleasure, misplaced branding and expensive mindfulness. We have become accustomed to being sold our feminine celebrations wrapped in empowerment, accustomed to every female emotion being price-tagged, sugared and sold back to us as feminist. For every occasion women have come to expect a slogan T-shirt telling us how fierce we are, and in every gift bag a book explaining, actually, how we could improve. This is how such celebrations are marked now, in cupcakes and sweet things to help the medicine go down. The history of Mother\\u2019s Day can be plotted back to ancient Greece, where they honoured Rhea, mother of many mythological gods who tricked her husband into swallowing a stone rather than their baby; then through to the Roman festival Hilaria, dedicated to another mother goddess, Cybele. In the 1600s, mothers were celebrated in England on the fourth Sunday of Lent, and the day was made official in 1872. Far be it from me to sigh at the modern world \\u2013 it has treated me well; I have two pairs of Uggs \\u2013 but even I can see a disconnect between the gentle honouring of women who bore us, and the sparkling confusion of politicised boredom. I will fight for the right of women to have afternoon teas at fancy hotels, and to wear a \\u201cBadass Mama\\u201d shirt, and for Dior to decorate their catwalk with feminist platitudes (\\u201cWomen\\u2019s love is unpaid labour\\u201d) in order to sell high-heeled boots.

The BBC has faced a series of challenges in recent times, most notably the arrival of subscription streaming services. Greg Dyke, the former director general, is among those to have described the licence fee as an anachronism. Oliver Dowden, the new culture secretary, has suggested that the funding and purpose of the BBC need to be examined. Hall writes: \\u201cIt\\u2019s true that some of the global streamers are now doing more to invest in some British content. But it comes nowhere near matching the BBC, and is there any guarantee it will continue? I wouldn\\u2019t like to bet on it. \\u201cEven where the big global streamers do invest in the UK, there is no evidence that they will support the breadth of British content that UK audiences rely on. Nor is there any guarantee they will make content that truly resonates with the lives of British audiences. Cultural influence from across the Atlantic is great if it adds to our choice. It is less great if it comes at the cost of our own, distinctively British culture.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 316}, {\"title\": \"'The Witcher\\u2019 Producers Assure Gamers Netflix Series Will Include All 400 Side Quests From \\u2018Wild Hunt\\u2019\", \"url\": \"https://ogn.theonion.com/the-witcher-producers-assure-gamers-netflix-series-wi-1839499728\", \"content\": \"Good news Witcher fans!

With the World Health Organization finally declaring a pandemic, all eyes have turned to the prospect of a vaccine, because only a vaccine can prevent people from getting sick. About 35 companies and academic institutions are racing to create such a vaccine, at least four of which already have candidates they have been testing in animals. The first of these \\u2013 produced by Boston-based biotech firm Moderna \\u2013 will enter human trials in April. This unprecedented speed is thanks in large part to early Chinese efforts to sequence the genetic material of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. China shared that sequence in early January, allowing research groups around the world to grow the live virus and study how it invades human cells and makes people sick. But there is another reason for the head start. Though nobody could have predicted that the next infectious disease to threaten the globe would be caused by a coronavirus \\u2013 flu is generally considered to pose the greatest pandemic risk \\u2013 vaccinologists had hedged their bets by working on \\u201cprototype\\u201d pathogens. \\u201cThe speed with which we have [produced these candidates] builds very much on the investment in understanding how to develop vaccines for other coronaviruses,\\u201d says Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Oslo-based nonprofit the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development. Coronaviruses have caused two other recent epidemics \\u2013 severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in China in 2002-04, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), which started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In both cases, work began on vaccines that were later shelved when the outbreaks were contained. One company, Maryland-based Novavax, has now repurposed those vaccines for Sars-CoV-2, and says it has several candidates ready to enter human trials this spring. Moderna, meanwhile, built on earlier work on the Mers virus conducted at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. Sars-CoV-2 shares between 80% and 90% of its genetic material with the virus that caused Sars \\u2013 hence its name. Both consist of a strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) inside a spherical protein capsule that is covered in spikes. The spikes lock on to receptors on the surface of cells lining the human lung \\u2013 the same type of receptor in both cases \\u2013 allowing the virus to break into the cell. Once inside, it hijacks the cell\\u2019s reproductive machinery to produce more copies of itself, before breaking out of the cell again and killing it in the process. All vaccines work according to the same basic principle. They present part or all of the pathogen to the human immune system, usually in the form of an injection and at a low dose, to prompt the system to produce antibodies to the pathogen. Antibodies are a kind of immune memory which, having been elicited once, can be quickly mobilised again if the person is exposed to the virus in its natural form. Traditionally, immunisation has been achieved using live, weakened forms of the virus, or part or whole of the virus once it has been inactivated by heat or chemicals. These methods have drawbacks. The live form can continue to evolve in the host, for example, potentially recapturing some of its virulence and making the recipient sick, while higher or repeat doses of the inactivated virus are required to achieve the necessary degree of protection. Some of the Covid-19 vaccine projects are using these tried-and-tested approaches, but others are using newer technology. One more recent strategy \\u2013 the one that Novavax is using, for example \\u2013 constructs a \\u201crecombinant\\u201d vaccine. This involves extracting the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of Sars-CoV-2, which is the part of the virus most likely to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and pasting it into the genome of a bacterium or yeast \\u2013 forcing these microorganisms to churn out large quantities of the protein. Other approaches, even newer, bypass the protein and build vaccines from the genetic instruction itself. This is the case for Moderna and another Boston company, CureVac, both of which are building Covid-19 vaccines out of messenger RNA. Cepi\\u2019s original portfolio of four funded Covid-19 vaccine projects was heavily skewed towards these more innovative technologies, and last week it announced $4.4m (\\u00a33.4m) of partnership funding with Novavax and with a University of Oxford vectored vaccine project. \\u201cOur experience with vaccine development is that you can\\u2019t anticipate where you\\u2019re going to stumble,\\u201d says Hatchett, meaning that diversity is key. And the stage where any approach is most likely to stumble is clinical or human trials, which, for some of the candidates, are about to get under way. Clinical trials, an essential precursor to regulatory approval, usually take place in three phases. The first, involving a few dozen healthy volunteers, tests the vaccine for safety, monitoring for adverse effects. The second, involving several hundred people, usually in a part of the world affected by the disease, looks at how effective the vaccine is, and the third does the same in several thousand people. But there\\u2019s a high level of attrition as experimental vaccines pass through these phases. \\u201cNot all horses that leave the starting gate will finish the race,\\u201d says Bruce Gellin, who runs the global immunisation programme for the Washington DC-based nonprofit, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, and is collaborating with Cepi over a Covid-19 vaccine. There are good reasons for that. Either the candidates are unsafe, or they\\u2019re ineffective, or both. Screening out duds is essential, which is why clinical trials can\\u2019t be skipped or hurried. Approval can be accelerated if regulators have approved similar products before. The annual flu vaccine, for example, is the product of a well-honed assembly line in which only one or a few modules have to be updated each year. In contrast, Sars-CoV-2 is a novel pathogen in humans, and many of the technologies being used to build vaccines are relatively untested too. No vaccine made from genetic material \\u2013 RNA or DNA \\u2013 has been approved to date, for example. So the Covid-19 vaccine candidates have to be treated as brand new vaccines, and as Gellin says: \\u201cWhile there is a push to do things as fast as possible, it\\u2019s really important not to take shortcuts.\\u201d An illustration of that is a vaccine that was produced in the 1960s against respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms in children. In clinical trials, this vaccine was found to aggravate those symptoms in infants who went on to catch the virus. A similar effect was observed in animals given an early experimental Sars vaccine. It was later modified to eliminate that problem but, now that it has been repurposed for Sars-CoV-2, it will need to be put through especially stringent safety testing to rule out the risk of enhanced disease. It\\u2019s for these reasons that taking a vaccine candidate all the way to regulatory approval typically takes a decade or more, and why President Trump sowed confusion when, at a meeting at the White House on 2 March, he pressed for a vaccine to be ready by the US elections in November \\u2013 an impossible deadline. \\u201cLike most vaccinologists, I don\\u2019t think this vaccine will be ready before 18 months,\\u201d says Annelies Wilder-Smith, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That\\u2019s already extremely fast, and it assumes there will be no hitches. In the meantime, there is another potential problem. As soon as a vaccine is approved, it\\u2019s going to be needed in vast quantities \\u2013 and many of the organisations in the Covid-19 vaccine race simply don\\u2019t have the necessary production capacity. Vaccine development is already a risky affair, in business terms, because so few candidates get anywhere near the clinic. Production facilities tend to be tailored to specific vaccines, and scaling these up when you don\\u2019t yet know if your product will succeed is not commercially feasible. Cepi and similar organisations exist to shoulder some of the risk, keeping companies incentivised to develop much-needed vaccines. Cepi plans to invest in developing a Covid-19 vaccine and boosting manufacturing capacity in parallel, and earlier this month it put out a call for $2bn to allow it to do so. Once a Covid-19 vaccine has been approved, a further set of challenges will present itself. \\u201cGetting a vaccine that\\u2019s proven to be safe and effective in humans takes one at best about a third of the way to what\\u2019s needed for a global immunisation programme,\\u201d says global health expert Jonathan Quick of Duke University in North Carolina, author of The End of Epidemics (2018). \\u201cVirus biology and vaccines technology could be the limiting factors, but politics and economics are far more likely to be the barrier to immunisation.\\u201d The problem is making sure the vaccine gets to all those who need it. This is a challenge even within countries, and some have worked out guidelines. In the scenario of a flu pandemic, for example, the UK would prioritise vaccinating healthcare and social care workers, along with those considered at highest medical risk \\u2013 including children and pregnant women \\u2013 with the overall goal of keeping sickness and death ra tes as low as possible. But in a pandemic, countries also have to compete with each other for medicines. Because pandemics tend to hit hardest those countries that have the most fragile and underfunded healthcare systems, there is an inherent imbalance between need and purchasing power when it comes to vaccines. During the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, for example, vaccine supplies were snapped up by nations that could afford them, leaving poorer ones short. But you could also imagine a scenario where, say, India \\u2013 a major supplier of vaccines to the developing world \\u2013 not unreasonably decides to use its vaccine production to protect its own 1.3 billion-strong population first, before exporting any. Outside of pandemics, the WHO brings governments, charitable foundations and vaccine-makers together to agree an equitable global distribution strategy, and organisations like Gavi, the vaccine alliance, have come up with innovative funding mechanisms to raise money on the markets for ensuring supply to poorer countries. But each pandemic is different, and no country is bound by any arrangement the WHO proposes \\u2013 leaving many unknowns. As Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, points out: \\u201cThe question is, what will happen in a situation where you\\u2019ve got national emergencies going on?\\u201d This is being debated, but it will be a while before we see how it plays out. The pandemic, says Wilder-Smith, \\u201cwill probably have peaked and declined before a vaccine is available\\u201d. A vaccine could still save many lives, especially if the virus becomes endemic or perennially circulating \\u2013 like flu \\u2013 and there are further, possibly seasonal, outbreaks. But until then, our best hope is to contain the disease as far as possible.

Working at Albert Park, he has remained in Melbourne. \\u201cWe said: \\u2018bugger it, we are going to stay here and go to a couple of restaurants and enjoy ourselves\\u2019,\\u201d he explains. Jones was hugely disappointed at the cancellation but accepts it was the right thing to do. The indomitable Australian can-do spirit tempered by the reality of the coronavirus. \\u201cFrom my point of view I would have gone ahead and done it anyway but you have to be sensible about the whole thing,\\u201d he says. Events had simply moved too quickly, precipitated by a member of the McLaren team testing positive. \\u201cDoing commentary for Channel 10, we had to be on top of the whole deal, seeing what was going on,\\u201d says Jones. \\u201cRight up until Friday we all thought that we can keep control of all of this. The catalyst to a certain degree was McLaren. That\\u2019s what lit the fuse. \\u201cIt is a big blow for Aussie sport, people have come from inter-state and internationally. I spoke to a pommie on Friday and he had flown from bloody England to come here, how bad would that be?\\u201d We Poms, among others, have been critical of F1 for attempting to run the race in the first place given the virulent spread of the coronavirus. Jones however insists that given the information they had, F1 were right to try and stage the meeting. \\u201cTwenty-twenty hindsight is a lovely thing to have,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI can\\u2019t fault them for coming here. It just accelerated and I don\\u2019t think anyone foresaw that. I think they thought they would be able to get it over and done with. Bear in mind five days before the GP we had 86,000 in the MCG watching the T20 final and that is a lot more confined than the open space of Albert Park.\\u201d In the wake of the cancellation, the opening of the F1 season is in tatters. The first four races, Australia, Bahrain, Vietnam and China have all been called off. The next three, all in Europe, the Dutch GP, Spain, and Monaco look highly unlikely to happen. The Australian Grand Prix corporation has not ruled out attempting to reschedule but with so little time on the calendar, the chances are negligible. \\u201cMy personal opinion is no they can\\u2019t run it again this year,\\u201d says Jones. \\u201cIf I was a betting man I would advise against it.\\u201d In 1980 Jones took the title for Williams, their first of seven drivers\\u2019 championships and the first of nine constructors\\u2019. The same year Jones won the Australian Grand Prix, then a non-championship race and he remains the last Australian to have done so. He had gone to England in 1967 to pursue his motor racing career. Initially Jones earned a living selling VW camper fans in what he calls \\u201cKangaroo Valley\\u201d \\u2013 London\\u2019s Earl\\u2019s Court, to \\u201cpoor unsuspecting Kiwis and Aussies\\u201d. With dogged determination he went after a place in F1. He had his first drive with Hesketh in Spain in 1975 and was hugely impressive in returning a win from 14th on the grid for the Shadow team at the \\u00d6sterreichring in 1978. \\u201cBecause I was going well in a Shadow, people were saying: \\u2018Look at Jonesy, he\\u2019s doing well in that old shitbox, isn\\u2019t he?,\\u201d he later recalled. A drive with Ferrari almost materialised but when the Scuderia opted for Gilles Villeneuve, Jones went to Williams. He, team founder Frank Williams and designer Patrick Head made a formidable, close-knit lineup. In 1980 Williams and Jones emerged triumphant after a strong fight with Nelson Piquet in the Brabham. Jones has retained close ties with Williams ever since and still has great fondness for the team. They have just endured their worst two seasons, last in both years, in their 42-year history but Jones, who spent time with the team in the paddock in Melbourne was confident they would come back. He was particularly dismissive of the criticism that deputy team principal, Claire Williams, Frank\\u2019s daughter has received. \\u201cEveryone is jumping on the bandwagon blaming Claire which is terribly unfair,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt is easy pickings for them because she is female which is very, very unfair. She is doing a good job and they will come good.\\u201d Jones is sure the Australian Grand Prix will return next year stronger than ever, at which he intends to renew the very personal attachment he has with the team where he made his name forty years ago. \\u201cFor Williams, from being no-ones and I mean that, to being a front-running F1 team is an extraordinary feat,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI hope to Christ they do come good because that\\u2019s my family.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 15, \"content_len\": 895}, {\"title\": \"'Putting us out on the streets': Seniors face eviction amid deadly outbreak\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/california-eviction-coronavirus-seniors-brookdale-san-pablo\", \"content\": \"At 82, Carley P Angell falls in the category for those at risk of serious illness if exposed to coronavirus. In two weeks, she could also end up in the same category as the tens of thousands in California who are at-risk and homeless. Public health officials are issuing warnings for those in her age range to stay home and self-isolate, but Angell and the 11 other seniors remaining at the Brookdale San Pablo assisted living facility still face eviction at the end of the month. \\u201cWe are scared,\\u201d Angell said. \\u201cWe realize we are a very vulnerable population. We\\u2019re the ones that coronavirus is hitting the hardest, and here we are, being forced out on to the streets with no place to go.\\u201d When a global pandemic hits a state already gripped by a housing affordability crisis, the impact is both devastating and far-reaching. Those on the margins bear the brunt the hardest, forced to venture out to fight for their housing when public health warnings are discouraging people from social contact. \\u201cWe\\u2019re caught between anxiety and terror,\\u201d Angell said. \\u201cSome of us don\\u2019t have places to go. We\\u2019ve been looking and we can\\u2019t afford them and the places we can afford are so awful, we and our children would not want us to go there.\\u201d In a state with sky-high rents, more than are willing to admit teeter on the edge of housing insecurity. Self-quarantine without the option to work from home, or getting sick without paid sick leave could mean not being able to pay the bills. Fewer work shifts because no one is going out to eat, or a cancelled gig because the governor recommended postponing large gatherings could mean not being able to make rent. \\u201cSo many of us are just one or two paychecks away from not being able to afford one of our basic needs, which is housing,\\u201d said Lupe Arreola, the executive director of Tenants Together. In a state with 17m renters, more than 55% are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Arreola said she\\u2019s concerned that many more will end up homeless in California because of coronavirus \\u2013 and before the outbreak is under control. \\u201cBeing evicted is horrible, but being evicted during a global health crisis and during an affordability crisis is the making of a societal disaster that will further complicate being able to have positive public health outcomes,\\u201d she said. The concern over the intersection of the coronavirus crisis and the housing crisis is enough that Sam Liccardo, the San Jose mayor, issued an eviction moratorium for people whose wages have been affected by coronavirus-related closures and cancellations. London Breed, the San Francisco mayor, issued a moratorium on Friday, and and Oakland is working on a similar measure as well. \\u201cThe impact of this is far and far-reaching,\\u201d said the San Francisco lawmaker Dean Preston, who introduced the legislation there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s lost income for a lot of folks. There are direct health impacts. There\\u2019s cancellation of events, there are folks who are small business owners who are struggling to stay afloat. Everyone is trying to make sure the impact of that is mitigated.\\u201d Though Merika Reagan considers herself lucky so far in terms of coronavirus-related cancellations, the panic and uncertainty is palpable on the pet care worker networks and message boards that she frequents. Dog walkers are posting about their walks getting cancelled because their clients are working from home now. Pet sitters are losing jobs because their clients will no longer travel \\u2013 Reagan, the owner of City Hikes Dog Walking and Pet Sitting, has had two cancellations and a third job fall through for this reason. She thinks herself lucky, but when she tallied up her losses, she realized she missed out on half a month\\u2019s rent. Her $2,250-a-month housing cost is always a concern for her. But she\\u2019s pragmatically optimistic when it comes to the coronavirus crisis \\u2013 if she loses more vacationers, she\\u2019ll make up the work elsewhere. \\u201cI\\u2019ll have to take on more walking clients, maybe two or three more, which will be murder on my ankles,\\u201d Reagan said. But if she gets sick? \\u201cI don\\u2019t get sick,\\u201d she said. \\u201cMy plan is to never get sick. That\\u2019s my plan. It sounds crazy, but that\\u2019s my plan.\\u201d \\u201cIn this business, if you don\\u2019t work you don\\u2019t get paid,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like you get paid time off.\\u201d Local lawmakers and tenant advocates hope that measures like an eviction moratorium can help ease the minds of workers like Reagan. \\u201cNo one should have to choose between their housing and their health,\\u201d Arreola said. But besides being the ethical choice, prohibiting evictions is strategic in curbing the spread of the virus, Preston said. \\u201cOne of the primary ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for folks to stay in their homes and if folks don\\u2019t have a home to go to, that\\u2019s impossible,\\u201d he said. That\\u2019s why Angell and the seniors at Brookdale San Pablo are petitioning California\\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to issue a moratorium on all evictions, coronavirus-related or otherwise, until the crisis passes. The seniors at Brookdale San Pablo were alerted at the end of November that Brookdale, a national senior-living company, was not renewing its lease. They thought that maybe another company that specialized in assisted living would take over, but in January, they received eviction notices from the building\\u2019s owner \\u2013 around the time coronavirus began to spread in China. There were 83 of them originally, and some left, forced to move farther away from their doctors and their families. Now 12 remain, with the cloud of coronavirus hanging overhead. \\u201cThe virus makes it much more difficult for us,\\u201d Angell said. \\u201cEverybody has been talking about the fact that even to go to look at a new place, if we got on paratransit and come back, it\\u2019s all risky.\\u201d She and the other seniors are determined to stay until the end.

Its occasional Marie-Antoinetteishness aside, maybe the Cambridges\\u2019 performed relatability really did signal the family\\u2019s acquisition, as widely advertised, of an emotional intelligence that will ultimately overturn its reputation for coldness, feuding, successive betrayals, and an HRH-stripping vengefulness towards family misfits, like Diana? As of last week, it seems clear that this was an utter misapprehension. Courtesy of their hilarious double act in Westminster Abbey, it seems much more likely that William and Catherine are already, as inheritance edges closer, about as emotionally literate as Prince Philip, as careless of their status as Prince Andrew, and as supremely forgiving to outcasts as the late Queen Mother. With a few differences. The old Queen could at least cite, as the justification for a lifelong grudge, her conviction that Wallis Simpson had devastated her own family life and ruined her husband\\u2019s health. All Meghan Markle appears to have done to deserve a comparable level of visible ostracism from Kate and William is to conclude \\u2013 admittedly rather late, and with scant notice \\u2013 that a lifetime dedicated to trailing mutely in their wake would be unbearable. As a result, one hears the left-behind royals may now have to open more things and meet more subjects than usual. You can see why this might seem, as well as a nuisance, a rather pointed commentary on the ghastly, state-maintained life that Kate Middleton wanted for herself. But even so. It\\u2019s not as if Meghan taught Kate\\u2019s kids to Nazi salute. And even minus their pretensions to leadership in talking/reaching out, blanking rarely-seen family members in a church, in public, isn\\u2019t the most civilised example from the Cambridges, future leaders of the family that, according to its own website, symbolically unifies the nation. Some viciously divorced civilians do better than this every week. Moreover, beaming impartially at friends and enemies is not even, unlike the Cambridges, a vital part of their day job. Kate, in particular, has previously demonstrated huge professionalism in this respect, bestowing the same, dazzling smile on Narenda Modi, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping as she does, crouching down in the curious way that royals consider essential in all child-encounters, on an innocent tot. Whatever crime Meghan and Harry have committed to be denied the same favour, it presumably strikes the Cambridges as worse than \\u2013 to pick at random, from the above guests\\u2019 specialities \\u2013 sexual predation, brutal dictatorship and tolerating extreme violence against women and girls. In the Abbey scene, surely the finest among the multiple glories of Harry and Meghan\\u2019s season one finale, we see a seated Meghan, smiling and waving like a pro at the approaching, then suddenly unsmiling Cambridges, who turn their backs, converse with everyone but them, then fall \\u2013 William going, unsuccessfully, for dignified composure, Kate pursing into an unforgiving little face that would have discomfited the chattiest of tyrants \\u2013 to ignoring them for the rest of the ceremony. Meghan, meanwhile, radiates artless goodwill. Her showy, green, caped outfit has already been acclaimed \\u2013 along with its companion blue, and red pieces \\u2013 as a superlatively choreographed, Diana-beating exercise in revenge dressing, but nothing confirmed the triumph that was the Sussexes\\u2019 peerlessly executed exit better than the antics of his family. An intended official humiliation \\u2013 with the Sussexes ostentatiously excluded from a royal parade \\u2013 concluded as a disastrous face-off: Eloi 1; Morlocks nil. By this time all but Meghan\\u2019s most dementedly racist persecutors must have spotted that, although well advised to swerve the oppressive littleness of much royal life, she is at the same time, given her ability to turn a secondary school visit into a touching national moment, its finest practitioner. All the family had to do was, for an hour or so, endure. When Hilary Mantel\\u2019s 2013 essay on royal wives, Royal Bodies, prompted accusations that she\\u2019d disrespected Kate (presumably, she wrote, the young woman was expected to \\u201cbreed in some manners\\u201d), the fuss obscured kindlier-sounding passages where she considered tawdry reminders for royals \\u2013 the just-out-of-sight stacked chairs, canap\\u00e9 detritus from a reception \\u2013 that their entire purpose is for show. \\u201cYou see,\\u201d Mantel wrote, \\u201cthat your life is a charade, that the scenery is cardboard, that the paint is peeling, the red carpet fraying, and if you linger you will notice the oily devotion fade from the faces of your subjects, and you will see their retreating backs as they turn up their collars and button their coats and walk away into real life.\\u201d Maybe it took a professional actress to insist, as seems to be the Sussexes\\u2019 plan, on a charade-life balance. It probably wasn\\u2019t their intention to appear in the Abbey \\u2013 as at the Albert Hall, or spotlit under an umbrella \\u2013 anything other than defiantly, hireably, fabulous. That their proximity was enough, however, to make at least two royal masks slip, perhaps exposes the misery, as well as the cultivated pettiness, of those left behind in captivity. \\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer colummnist\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 24, \"content_len\": 981}, {\"title\": \"Mae Martin: \\u2018It\\u2019s enriching to share things you\\u2019re ashamed of\\u2019\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/15/mae-martin-comedian-addict-television-channel-4-feel-good-lisa-kudrow\", \"content\": \"Mae Martin is an addict. At the age of six, she was addicted to Bette Midler. It was a curious, grand, important feeling and one she knew she must indulge alone, in her room after dinner. At 11, after she was invited up on stage to pretend to be a ventriloquist\\u2019s dummy, and there felt the full force of an audience\\u2019s laughter, Martin became addicted to standup comedy, leaving school three years later to perform full-time. She would walk onstage at 14 with a cigarette to complicated silences, and spend her evenings with adults, and their alcohol, and their cocaine. At 16 she was addicted to drugs and her parents kicked her out. Now 32, having been through rehab and moved from Toronto to London, she has used her 10,000-plus hours of standup to carve out a unique place in British comedy where she talks about all of these things; a place that is warm and clean and wise, and very funny. Shrugging off her jacket on a winterish afternoon last month, Martin was cautious but charming. White-haired, wide-eyed, she appeared freshly hatched. She\\u2019d just come from having a new suit fitted \\u2013 the answer, hopefully, to her long-standing anxieties over how to dress in order to feel like herself. Except, the tailor kept referencing Ellen DeGeneres when she had been quite clear that he was to cut the suit with Leonardo DiCaprio in mind, and only Leonardo DiCaprio. I could clearly picture the conversation: her polite insistence that he accept who she told him she was, rather than impose his own ideas. This will not be her first suit. As a child, she wore a three-piece suit and bow tie, and it was in this divine little outfit that her parents first took her to see the standup shows that would change her life. \\u201cWatching comedy for the first time I felt absolutely on fire. I just couldn\\u2019t believe there was this environment where people were being applauded for the weirdest things about themselves,\\u201d she says, opening her eyes even wider. \\u201cEspecially feeling like an outsider at school, and then finding this community where I could own those things and be applauded for them. People who would laugh with me instead of at me.\\u201d There\\u2019s a video on YouTube of her performing at 16, in character as a competitor in a public-speaking competition about \\u201cwomen in media\\u201d. The audience seems equal parts dazzled and confused by the combination of lonely desperation and Buffy the Vampire Slayer obsession she presents, in cropped hair and pinafore dress. These days audiences are less confused; instead of leading with her awkwardness, she explores it, performs it and invites us to laugh at it with her. Her most recent standup tours were Us, in 2015, about sex and gender identity, and Dope, in 2017, about addiction \\u2013 both were turned into BBC radio shows. \\u201cIt was a slow process of getting closer and closer to my actual personality on stage. And now there\\u2019s very little separation. I definitely find the more open and vulnerable I am, the more people enjoy it,\\u201d she grins in understatement. \\u201cThe first time I saw Mae\\u2019s work,\\u201d the actor Ellen Page says via email, \\u201cI not only laughed so hard, I was struck by her honesty, vulnerability, intelligence and ability to tell personal stories that render them relatable to us all. I am inspired by Mae,\\u201d she adds, \\u201cand lucky to call her a friend.\\u201d Today audiences treat Martin with a similarly delicate awe. Usually. \\u201cWell, I got heckled the other night. I was talking about gender identity and this woman shouted, \\u2018No one cares!\\u2019 It was so harsh, but I couldn\\u2019t stop laughing. Partly because I was in control and partly because, well, I replied something like, \\u2018The problem is that people actually care too much!\\u2019 There\\u2019s so much hysteria around gender, hysteria that comes from a place of misinformation and fear.\\u201d She shrugs. Chuckles. Once, a therapist warned her that if she completed therapy, she\\u2019d probably stop being funny. \\u201cI was, like, \\u2018I disagree.\\u2019 I knew my job was not mutually exclusive to happiness. I think she was romanticising that tortured-artist thing, which I don\\u2019t buy into any more. Really. If you\\u2019re unhappy, you can\\u2019t make anything.\\u201d Dope, her show on addiction, took longer to brew. \\u201cYeah, I needed enough distance from that time in my life to\\u2026 retrospect. I approached it pretty academically and did tonnes of research and tried to make sense of it. And then I started telling my stories on stage and hoping the punchlines emerged.\\u201d What did she learn? \\u201cI guess the big realisation was that addiction isn\\u2019t really about substances. The definition that I use is from [writer and physician] Dr Gabor Mat\\u00e9, which is: addiction is something that you crave, find relief from and can\\u2019t give up, despite knowing the negative consequences.\\u201d Imagine, she asks her audiences, that they\\u2019ve just realised they\\u2019ve left their phone in the bar \\u2013 they wouldn\\u2019t burst into tears, but the nagging anxiety, the need to touch it again, would mean they wouldn\\u2019t laugh for the rest of the show. \\u201cRight? His is such a broad definition and resonates with so many people, whether it\\u2019s our phones or food or sex or relationships. Things that we know are bad for us, but that soothe us when we\\u2019re finding the present moment difficult. Hearing that was kind of a breakthrough for me.\\u201d Why? \\u201cBecause I think I was patting myself on the back for getting off drugs and not realising, actually, that addictive behaviour was still permeating my life in a lot of ways. So that\\u2019s what the TV series is about.\\u201d The TV series, yes. We are here to discuss Feel Good, a new Channel 4 comedy, co-written by and starring Martin as a comedian called Mae, navigating the sensitive dynamics of her NA group, a relationship with a straight girl (played by Charlotte Ritchie), and a strained bond with her mother, performed magnificently by Lisa Kudrow. \\u201cThe character Mae is where I was about 10 years ago. So it\\u2019s a pretty tenuous grip on sobriety, just fresh out of the depths of addiction and super manic. I have a pretty good hold on my life now \\u2013 I\\u2019m pretty stable. But I definitely feel like, in a way\\u2026 I miss her.\\u201d The old Mae is seen on screen as a panicked romantic who lies awake at night with her hands hovering in fists above her chest. \\u201cShe\\u2019s a mess, with all her agony and ecstasy, but I do miss the optimism and naivety. I don\\u2019t miss the lows, but losing those sometimes means you don\\u2019t get the highs.\\u201d Five years ago Martin transferred her addictive obsession on to this script, this series, and she digs her hands into her knees at the thought that soon it will be out, in the world, with all the judgment and mainstream fame that might mean. She wants to be clear: it is comedy, not therapy. \\u201cNo this is not purely some cathartic therapeutic exercise for me. Me and Joe [Hampson, her co-writer] really just wanted to write a good comedy that had a lot of heart. It\\u2019s a work of fiction. But it\\u2019s got an emotional truth, because it\\u2019s based on experiences I\\u2019ve had. I\\u2019ve dated lots of girls who\\u2019ve never been with a girl before, for instance, which makes for quite a romantic and painful dynamic.\\u201d And for all the pain of bleeding her own life into six half-hours, the surprise agony actually came from acting for the first time. \\u201cI sort of thought acting was just about arranging your face into emotions. I didn\\u2019t realise it was about actually allowing yourself to feel the feelings, then letting your face follow. That was a big learning curve.\\u201d Actually allowing herself to feel the feelings has been a lesson in more ways than one. Since discussing her childhood and addictions on stage, Martin\\u2019s life has expanded, along with her career. \\u201cIt\\u2019s enriching and cathartic to share things that your gut tells you are not all right to say. To say things that you\\u2019re embarrassed or ashamed of, and then have everybody go: \\u2018Me too.\\u2019 And the more specific and embarrassing, the more people seem to connect.\\u201d During her show about gender and sexuality, she witnessed lots of teenagers coming out to their friends and family. After one show, a girl approached Martin with her father, before turning to him and saying, \\u2018Dad, I\\u2019m bisexual.\\u2019 \\u201cAnd do you know what he replied? \\u2018Me too.\\u2019\\u201d How did that feel? \\u201cIt was cool! But I\\u2019m not a licensed family therapist, so it was also quite scary. Especially because then they wanted to go out to a club. I was like, \\u2018I\\u2019m gonna pass.\\u2019 With the next show, Dope, I saw a lot of addicts or people who have family members struggling with addictions. That was pretty wild. But I love it all.\\u201d Last year she wrote a book for teenagers, a guide to 21st-century sexuality. \\u201cI had to constantly remind people that I\\u2019m just writing about my experiences. It\\u2019s different for everyone \\u2013 the most important thing is not to be squeamish. Talking about sexuality and gender right now is so politicised, but imagine being a teenager in your first relationship, and how stressful it would feel if you were seeing your identity debated on Newsnight. And so I try to take a lighter look, and remind people that it\\u2019s supposed to be fun and also, that you don\\u2019t have to feel pressured to pick a certain label.\\u201d The book\\u2019s title is Can Everyone Please Calm Down? As well as belly laughs, Martin\\u2019s audiences have become accustomed to feeling something slightly higher up: a light pressure on their heart, for example, or a tightening of the throat, or a small nudge on the brain. Her favourite comedians can, she says, \\u201cDo both \\u2013 be really hilarious while also sneaking in a social message.\\u201d On stage she offers a critical analysis of contemporary obsessions, stories from her own life weaving through a theme, resulting in yes, punchlines, but also tight political conclusions \\u2013 such as her insistence that we should eliminate labels like gay, straight, or bi. \\u201cI\\u2019m all for people identifying however they want. But I\\u2019ve found that sometimes those labels bulldoze over nuance. My sexuality is not a huge part of who I am! It\\u2019s not even a particularly interesting part. Apparently 40% of people under 25 don\\u2019t identify as gay or straight any more. So I feel like that\\u2019s where we are heading. If we just assume everyone\\u2019s a bit gay, then we wouldn\\u2019t have to go through that quite harrowing process of declaring yourself to be something else. Yeah, I see a lot of benefits to not expecting everyone to declare who they are.\\u201d I wonder whether researching her own life for a show has brought up any surprising realisations. \\u201cWell, one thing I found interesting is this false impression that gender fluidity or \\u2018dismantling the gender binary\\u2019 is a recent millennial fad, when, for centuries of human civilisation, there have been variances in gender. It\\u2019s actually quite a recent western thing to have such a strict gender binary. In 2018, India decriminalised homosexuality, and we celebrated it over here. But, England went into India and criminalised homosexuality in 1856! It\\u2019s the gaslighting that gets me. It\\u2019s like setting somebody\\u2019s house on fire and then going, \\u2018Argh, it\\u2019s taking me so long to put the fire out, like, it\\u2019s sooo hard.\\u201d She is fun to sit with. An afternoon discussing social politics with a comedian more brusque or earnest than Martin would be a slightly exhausting prospect. But she treads so lightly and with such conviction that the segues from her coconut allergy to the reaction to strap-on dildos in Feel Good to trans rights carry me gently and jollily through our conversation. It\\u2019s only later, transcribing, that it strikes me how radical her post-identity politics might be. \\u201cI totally understand people feeling overwhelmed, or feeling a sense of vertigo about how quickly things are changing. But everyone needs to take a deep breath and look at the facts and not the headlines.\\u201d She searches quickly for an example from life. \\u201cI remember when I first learned algebra and I got into this real angry panic because I was like, \\u2018I just figured out numbers \\u2013 and now they\\u2019re introducing letters again?\\u2019\\u201d That was when she left school. \\u201cI think that\\u2019s the kind of thing people feel is happening now, and they\\u2019re panicking. But it\\u2019s actually not that confusing, if you listen properly.\\u201d Then she says something that, in 2020, feels oddly like the most radical concept of all. Martin leans in. \\u201cI\\u2019m a big advocate of the idea that ambiguity, of the idea that not knowing\\u201d \\u2013 who you are, who you love, where to put your hands when you sleep, or why Bette Midler stirred such longing in a six-year-old Canadian child \\u2013 \\u201cis fine.\\u201d Unexpectedly, I laugh.

In recent days both Brazil\\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro and Mexico\\u2019s Andr\\u00e9s Manuel L\\u00f3pez Obrador \\u2013 nationalists from opposite ends of the political spectrum \\u2013 have enraged opponents and observers by making high-profile public appearances in which they came into close physical contact with citizens. They did so in defiance of medical advice and despite growing alarm over the spread of the virus through Latin America, where at least 17 countries have confirmed cases. Bolsonaro, a far-right rabble-rouser who recently dismissed coronavirus as a media \\u201cfantasy\\u201d, left his presidential palace on Sunday to exchange fist bumps and mingle with supporters who turned out for highly controversial protests targeting Brazil\\u2019s democratic institutions. \\u201cThis is priceless. We politicians must change Brazil\\u2019s destiny,\\u201d Bolonsaro enthused during his hour-long jaunt, during which he used supporters\\u2019 mobile phones to take selfies before handing them back into the crowd. Bolsonaro left his palace despite reportedly being placed in isolation there on Friday after members of a Brazilian delegation to the US, which he led, were found to have contracted the virus. Bolsonaro claimed he tested negative for coronavirus on Friday after initial reports that a preliminary test came back positive. The president is due to repeat the test next week and at least five senior officials have been confirmed to have coronavirus, including communications chief F\\u00e1bio Wajngarten and ambassador to the US Nestor Forster. On Friday one of Bolsonaro\\u2019s doctors told the conservative Estado de S\\u00e3o Paulo newspaper the president would be \\u201cquarantined\\u201d until early next week. Bolsonaro\\u2019s decision to ignore that advice on Sunday sparked fury among critics and commentators. Gleisi Hoffmann, president of Brazil\\u2019s leftist Workers\\u2019 party, tweeted: \\u201cThe country needs a responsible and serious government that thinks first about the population. But what we have in the presidency is a loud-mouthed coward who behaves like a boor.\\u201d The political commentator Vera Magalh\\u00e3es tweeted: \\u201cPresident Bolsonaro is promoting corona day\\u201d Major cities including Rio de Janeiro and S\\u00e3o Paulo have unveiled tough measures to fight coronavirus, including the closure of schools, creches, nightclubs and cinemas. Brazilian authorities have confirmed at least 121 cases and have advised citizens to remain at home. But on Sunday Bolsonaro used his official Twitter account to encourage controversial street protests targeting his political enemies in congress. One prominent Bolsonarista congressman tweeted: \\u201cPandemic my arse\\u201d. In an editorial, the Estado de S\\u00e3o Paulo lamented: \\u201cThe major crisis Brazil now faces isn\\u2019t the stuttering economy or the threat of coronavirus. The real crisis is lacking a government when one is needed most.\\u201d Mexico\\u2019s leftwing president, L\\u00f3pez Obrador, who some compare to Bolsonaro despite their ideological differences, is also facing criticism for what many see as his cavalier attitude to the crisis. On Saturday, as authorities announced schools would be suspended until at least 20 April, he tweeted a video of himself hugging fans, posing for photos and even kissing one child during a visit to the south-western state of Guerrero. \\u201cLeaving the hotel in Ometepec, I greeted and attended to the petitions of the people,\\u201d L\\u00f3pez Obrador tweeted. The president, best known as Amlo, also suggested Mexicans read Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garc\\u00eda M\\u00e1rquez, calling it \\u201ca balm to calm us\\u201d. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Mexico continued to increase: 41 were counted on Saturday, according to the health secretariat, 15 more than the day before. Mexico has been slow to impose travel restrictions and testing has been scant. The public education secretariat, however, announced an extension of the Easter break, starting on 20 March. Not all public events have been called off, with Amlo\\u2019s administration citing economic considerations. The Mexican football league continues and a massive music festival headlined by Guns N\\u2019 Roses attracted 40,000 fans on Saturday. Xavier Tello, a healthcare consultant in Mexico City, said health authorities were slowly changing their position but their leader remained in \\u201ctotal denial\\u201d. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s dangerous,\\u201d he said.

It was, said the Wordsworth expert Kathleen Jones, an \\u201camazingly close bond\\u201d founded on the deep psychological trauma of being split up as young children and then reunited in their late teens. The National Trust is staging the exhibition at its property Wordsworth House and Garden in Cockermouth, Cumbria, to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the poet\\u2019s birth. It explores Wordsworth\\u2019s childhood and how his life and poetry was shaped by the wild, outdoor upbringing he and his sister enjoyed at the house on the banks of the River Derwent. Among the exhibits will be Dorothy\\u2019s tiny baby bonnet, handsewn most likely by their mother Ann. It is the only item from their childhood to survive. William was eight and Dorothy was seven when their mother died and they were split up. She was sent to relatives in Yorkshire and five years later they became orphans when their father died. Dorothy did not reunite with her brother for nine years. \\u201cDorothy was passed around like a parcel,\\u201d said Jones. \\u201cIt had a deep psychological impact. \\u201cFor someone like Dorothy who was very sensitive, very emotional \\u2013 what we\\u2019d now call highly strung \\u2013 that childhood bond with her brother was all she could remember of security and love, everything to do with family.\\u201d When they finally met again a syndrome called \\u201cgenetic attraction\\u201d happened, said Jones. \\u201cThey looked into each other\\u2019s eyes and they saw a similar person with similar feelings \\u2026 this is what happens when you fall in love with someone. You meet someone and think wow this person is so like me, all that empathy, everything. They had shared so much.\\u201d When William married his wife Mary, Dorothy went through a type of grief which led him to giving his sister his wedding ring to wear before the big day. \\u201cAn extraordinary thing to do,\\u201d said Jones. Dorothy then lived with William and Mary for the rest of her life. \\u201cHis wife must have been very patient,\\u201d said Gilbert. \\u201cThere were always three in the relationship.\\u201d The childhood of William and Dorothy and its effect on their lives is explored in a series of films at the exhibition featuring Jones and the poet Helen Mort. Jones argues that Dorothy was an astute judge of her brother\\u2019s poetry and played an important part in his wellbeing. He was \\u201ca man who needed a lot of positive reinforcement and Dorothy gave him that\\u201d. The exhibition title, The Child is Father of the Man, comes from a line in Wordsworth\\u2019s 1802 poem My Heart Leaps Up. He is suggesting that childhood experiences help form an adult\\u2019s character, but also that people should hold on to their childhood sense of wonder in the natural beauty of the world. The bonnet is a remarkable survivor, with no one knowing quite how it came to be passed down over 250 years to its current owners, the Wordsworth Trust in Grasmere. Gilbert said: \\u201cAnybody visiting this year will see how events from childhood, objects which have survived or been lost, and other memories can connect them to their own past. \\u201cDorothy\\u2019s baby bonnet, as the sole item to remain from the siblings\\u2019 childhood, is especially precious and evocative.\\u201d The exhibition also features objects from William\\u2019s later life, including his ice skates and his tinted spectacles, which shine a light on the poet\\u2019s lifelong anxieties about health and his fear of going blind. \\u2022 The Child is Father of the Man is at Wordsworth House and Garden, 14 March-8 November.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 656}, {\"title\": \"Annoying YouTube Algorithm Not Letting Man Forget Single Time He Watched 14 Hours Straight Of Hitler Speeches\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/annoying-youtube-algorithm-not-letting-man-forget-singl-1832630535\", \"content\": \"Wishing he could return to browsing golf instructional videos in peace, local resident Brian O\\u2019Connell reportedly expressed irritation Thursday that an annoying YouTube algorithm was not letting him forget the single time he watched 14 straight hours of Hitler speeches. \\u201cIt\\u2019s so aggravating, I mean, all I did was watch one full day of Hitler speeches\\u2014it\\u2019s kind of creepy that they even track that sort of thing,\\u201d said O\\u2019Connell, adding that it was impossible for him to focus on baseball highlights while his \\u201cAutoplay\\u201d column was filled with videos claiming to expose the insidious Jewish conspiracies undermining the establishment of a white ethnostate. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s even more frustrating is that it keeps trying to push more Hitler speeches on me.

It is still premature to ask for certainty about what will happen and all the questions are tendered with an acknowledgement there are many more important problems for the country to consider first. Nonetheless, the realisation has dawned on many senior football people that matches are very unlikely to resume on the provisional dates pencilled in, Friday 3 April for the Football League, the following day for the Premier League. The leagues\\u2019, the FA\\u2019s and Uefa\\u2019s official positions are to hope their competitions can be completed, but the course of the virus is not expected even to peak until May or June, so playing at the start of April looks impossible. Uefa will hold its teleconference on Tuesday with all 55 of Europe\\u2019s national football associations, the European Club Association, European leagues and the international players\\u2019 union, Fifpro, when Euro 2020 is expected to be postponed. The Premier League has scheduled a meeting of clubs on Thursday when serious discussions will be held over what on earth happens next. Those who run the sport are picking their way through this unmapped, dark and rapidly shifting terrain as gingerly, daily, step by step, as everybody else is having to in their own lives. The Premier League and EFL moved in barely an hour on Thursday night from saying that, following government advice, this weekend\\u2019s matches would be played as normal, to receiving news of Mikel Arteta\\u2019s positive diagnosis for Covid-19 and cancelling all matches for three weeks. Regardless of the official position, senior people were very quickly contemplating the likelihood that no more football will be played for months and this season may not be completed. The postponement was not quite about protecting public health, as the government advice remained that matches could be played and the risk of contagion among crowds was not yet too strong. It was the Arteta diagnosis, leading to the self-isolation of the Arsenal players, and the similar self\\u2011isolation of other clubs\\u2019 players and staff, that led to the conclusion that playing had become impossible. A Premier League club executive, who did not want to be named given the acute sensitivities of this crisis, said sports scientists\\u2019 advice is that a player needs one day of training for every day of isolation before they can be match fit. So the advisory 14-day isolation doubles to 28 days out of action. It appears close to impossible for squads, managers, coaching and other staff to operate at full strength as the virus spreads, peaks and runs its course. The chief executive, like other senior figures, believes it is \\u201calmost certain the league will finish at this point\\u201d. Even if Uefa vacates the month of Euro 2020, from the 12 June scheduled first game in Rome to the 12 July final at Wembley, the idea of stretching the season into the summer and beyond is more complicated than it looks. Players\\u2019 contracts run to 30 June so the idea of carrying on with squads after that is described as so fraught as to be almost impossible. The question of how to decide the title, promotion and relegation, Champions League qualification places, if the season ends now, moved in days from an interesting hypothetical to a genuine practical issue. West Ham\\u2019s Karren Brady, who wrote in Saturday\\u2019s Sun that the season should be declared null and void, is not the only Premier League club executive advancing that as a solution. A director of another club, who did not want to air his thoughts as publicly, said that while clubs could still garner enough points to change their positions, none will want to accept a disadvantage, especially given the huge sporting and financial gap between the Premier League and Championship. Scrapping the season is the only solution that avoids a descent into litigation by those who would lose out if current places are converted into permanence, he said. Another executive said they could do that, but avoid rancourous battles with a more creative solution: reward the winners but reprieve the losers. If the season needs to be considered finished at this stage, Liverpool, 25 points ahead at the top, would be awarded the title they have waited 30 years to reclaim and nobody could justifiably argue. Leeds and West Brom should go up, he said, but no club be relegated and the Premier League could play next season with 22 clubs. Those in the promotion places in Leagues One and Two and the National League should be promoted and the numbers made up by none going down. The leagues could readjust their numbers with more clubs relegated over the next couple of seasons. Those in play-off places could legitimately argue they may have made it to automatic promotion, but none would suffer an actual major loss. These scenarios are so speculative as to be the private thoughts of people still stunned by this nightmare event, but discussions will solidify this coming week. As for the financial hit, it will be unavoidable if the season does not finish. Sky and BT Sport, whose holding position is not to give subscribers refunds while this remains a short postponement, would have to do so if the season is cancelled. The broadcasters are thought to have the contractual right to withhold multimillions from the leagues, although given their longstanding relationships and the nature of this crisis, the leagues would be hopeful of an accommodation. It has not yet been made clear even to the clubs if the leagues have insurance to cover the loss of broadcasting income in these extraordinary circumstances. Some clubs do have \\u201cbusiness interruption\\u201d insurance to cover them for the loss of matchday revenues, but this is thought to become less common down the pyramid. Lower division Football League clubs, which rely on ticket income and are more financially fragile, are considered most at risk of falling into difficulties. The government has been made aware of this national sport\\u2019s vulnerabilities and there is some hope that public money could provide a safety net. But, really, after a decade of austerity and underfunding of the NHS, everybody knows the government has many more urgent priorities and attending to football\\u2019s financial ailments will not be top of the list.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 1108}, {\"title\": \"Coronavirus: Australian infections rise to over 250 as Vivid cancels but NRL matches continue\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-australian-infections-rise-as-vivid-cancelled-but-nrl-matches-to-continue\", \"content\": \"The Vivid Sydney light festival has been cancelled due to measures put in place to limit public gatherings to slow the spread of coronavirus, as the number of diagnoses in Australia continues to rise. However, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition \\u2013 without crowds \\u2013 into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. The number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New South Wales rose by 22 in 24 hours to 134, with more than 250 cases nationally. In Victoria, the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said eight new cases had been confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 57. In Tasmania, passengers and crew were barred from disembarking from a cruise ship that docked in Hobart. The NSW tourism minister, Stuart Ayres, said the decision to cancel Vivid was made after recommendations from the federal government to limit non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people. Vivid, now in its 11th year, was scheduled to run from 22 May to 13 June. \\u201cVivid Sydney is a bright star of Sydney\\u2019s event calendar so the decision to cancel was not taken lightly. As the event owner, we must follow the advice of health officials to ensure the health and safety of our citizens and everyone involved with Vivid Sydney,\\u201d Ayres said. \\u201cWe have taken the decision early in consideration of those planning to travel to Sydney for the festival, our commercial partners, artists, and volunteers so as to minimise the disruption and impact on them. \\u201cWe are currently working through the full implications of the cancellation and will provide further information and advice as soon as it\\u2019s available.\\u201d In 2019, a record 2.4 million attended Vivid, bringing $172m into the NSW economy. Ayres said the decision to cancel was \\u201canother body blow\\u201d for the tourism industry, which has already endured challenges as a result of the bushfire crisis. In NSW an additional 22 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 between 11am on Saturday and 11am on Sunday, NSW Health said in a statement. The new cases include three people who recently returned from the United States, one who had returned from Singapore and another from the Philippines. Five people caught the infection after contact with other confirmed cases of COVID-19. The source for the remainder of the 22 new cases is under investigation, however two of those had also travelled overseas recently, including one to the United States. NSW Health said of the 134 cases, 60 were acquired overseas while 38 were infected after contact with a confirmed case. The remaining were either unknown or under investigation. A further 1,924 cases in NSW were being investigated as possible Covid-19 cases while 20,511 people have been tested and cleared. Meanwhile, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. New Zealand\\u2019s NRL\\u2019s team the Warriors will stay in Australia after travel restrictions were announced by the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern. The second round will go ahead as scheduled without crowds. \\u201cIn the interim we will continue round two. At this stage we will play round two and assess the situation,\\u201d the Australian Rugby League commission chairman, Peter V\\u2019landys, said. In Hobart, passengers and crews were told not to leave a cruise ship that docked in the city on Saturday. About 1,400 passengers and staff aboard the MSC Magnifica were told they could not return to the ship if they disembarked, an MSC Cruises spokeswoman told the Mercury. No one on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers\\u2019 health. The ship left Italy in early January before the coronavirus became a global concern. Tasmania\\u2019s acting director of public health, Scott McKeown, said on Saturday the state now had its sixth confirmed case of Covid-19 after a woman in her 60s tested positive. She was identified as a close contact of a previous Tasmanian case, who had recently travelled overseas, McKeown said on Sunday. The woman and all the other five cases in Tasmania were in a stable condition and remained in isolation receiving medical care. The state\\u2019s Public Health Services had identified and contacted the woman\\u2019s close contacts. These people will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days and receive daily follow-up from PHS staff. The new cases in Victoria this weekend include six men and two women with ages ranging from their teens to 60s. One is a student \\u2013 a known contact of case 17, a teacher from Carey Grammar. The student was not at school during their infectious period. The school will remain closed until the holidays. And as a precaution, 12 classmates will home-isolate. Sutton said all cases were recovering at home in isolation. All had acquired the infection from either overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19. At present, there remained only one case in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 14, \"content_len\": 831}, {\"title\": \"Tennis players face a difficult future as non-stop tours shut down\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/15/tennis-coronavirus-outbreak-professional-tours-shutdown\", \"content\": \"The only thing on Yannick Maden\\u2019s agenda at the beginning of last week was tennis, yet instead he found himself caught up in the rapidly shifting foreign policy of a world changed by coronavirus. Ranked 149th on the ATP, Maden planned his travel to Nur-Sultan, the capital city of Kazakhstan, to compete in a \\u20ac48k ATP Challenger event. Doubts were already swirling around the tournament as he considered whether to take his flight \\u2013 a German ATP tournament supervisor had already recused himself from the event \\u2013 but Kazakhstan had yet to record a significant number of cases so the decision seemed to be simple. \\u201cI waited and waited, and then on Monday there was no news, everything the same,\\u201d Maden told me during a phone interview. \\u201cSo I took the decision to fly. Everything there was calm, and there were two German guys there already that told me this, which was normal.\\u201d Normality eventually dissolved through the screen of Maden\\u2019s phone as he viewed a screenshot sent by a friend. The rumours that Kazakhstan\\u2019s authorities would put Germans, Italians and the French into a mandatory quarantine appeared to be true. Maden was scheduled to compete on Wednesday, yet by Tuesday night he and two other pros from France and Germany were calling around consulates and embassies, trying to figure out if they were to be stuck in a foreign country for 14 days. It wasn\\u2019t until lunchtime on Wednesday that they received an answer. As the warm-up for his impending match approached, Maden learnt he likely had just half a day to leave the country before he was locked down in his hotel room. Within hours he was at the airport and tearing out of the country on a flight to Moscow and then home in Stuttgart. His was one of an unprecedented nine non-medical withdrawals throughout the week in Kazakhstan. \\u201cAt the end, we were at the airport for our 4.30pm flight when I heard from some Austrian guy that, for sure, we would have been put in quarantine from midnight. In the end, it was the right decision,\\u201d he said. He paused and then laughed. \\u201cOr the wrong decision for me to even fly there. We were not extremely stressed in the way that we were fearful, but we did not want to be put in quarantine. That was the main goal.\\u201d The essence of tennis is that it never stops. The full professional calendar spans 51 weeks of the year. Even when the likes of Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are far from the courts for their own paltry four-week off\\u2011season, there is normally always somebody, somewhere competing in a live streamed tournament and being awarded points under the same ranking system. As a result, the domino effect of tennis coming to a halt has been a worldwide phenomenon. In Indian Wells, 200 of the best male and female players were blindsided by the news that it had been called off. After days of debates between the players stranded in the Californian desert, both across the grounds and in mammoth Whatsapp groups, the ATP, WTA and ITF suspended the tour for 5-6 weeks. Jack Draper, Britain\\u2019s best young player, did not even have the opportunity to contemplate his future. The 19 year old was 1hr 44min into his quarter-final match against Tobias Simon at the Potchefstroom $35k challenger in South Africa when rain began to pour and they were hauled off the court with Draper leading 5-4 in the third set. The ATP announced the immediate suspension of the tour during the delay and they never made it back to the court. The match was cancelled and promptly erased from the record books. \\u201cWas just about to get the break as well,\\u201d Draper tweeted afterwards. The political manoeuverings borne out of coronavirus affected countless players. Dayana Yastremska, a highly rated 19-year-old, panicked after Donald Trump announced his European travel ban. In the fear that she would be trapped in the US, she immediately flitted to the airport and back to Ukraine. Zhu Lin, a Chinese player who lives in Beijing, did not buy a plane ticket out of California until Friday. The uncertainty of Chinese athletes abroad was reflected in her asking her fans on Weibo where on earth she would go if she couldn\\u2019t make it back home: \\u201cI bought my plane ticket but flight might be blocked,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cIf I change flight to other countries, I would get sent to quarantine. Feels too risky to stay in the US. Please give me some suggestions.\\u201d Maden says his current ranking, which peaked at 96 last year, has earnt him enough money for a worry-free six weeks. He will be fine. But tennis players are self-employed and earn money when they play. Like so many workers in affected areas around the world, some lower-ranked players face an extremely difficult time ahead. \\u201cIt\\u2019s unfortunate because there is no income coming in and no chance of income. That would be the uncertainty, that would be the most frustrating or unsure aspect,\\u201d says Maden. Although tennis set the tone early on with its cancellations, the other sports slowly followed last week. The discourse and decision making seem to reflect the widespread consideration of sports as an escape from the real world, rather than part of it. Almost all of the discussed coronavirus contingency plans in the NBA, Premier League and elsewhere focused on how to manage fans without ever taking into account the fact that the athletes themselves might contract the virus anyway. At the very least, the historic past week should be a reminder that sports and the athletes within them cannot be separated from the world around them and that is how people should always write, think and talk about them.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 965}, {\"title\": \"Mike Pence Disappointed God Has Never Asked Him To Kill One Of Own Children\", \"url\": \"http://www.theonion.com/article/mike-pence-disappointed-god-has-never-asked-him-ki-55239?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=feeds\", \"content\": \"Saying he would surely rise to the occasion if tasked by the Almighty with the ultimate test of faith, Vice President Mike Pence said Monday that he was disappointed that God has never called upon him to kill one of his own children. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just heartbreaking that the Lord hasn\\u2019t summoned me once to show my dedication to Him by sacrificing one of my precious kids,\\u201d said Pence, telling reporters that he has spent years waiting for any sign at all from the Heavenly Father that he should ritually slaughter one of his three children. \\u201cThey\\u2019re grown now, so I\\u2019m starting to think I\\u2019ll never get the chance to offer the blood of any of them to prove my unshakable devotion.

The campaign will kick off on Monday and include digital billboards, and bus shelter and telephone booth advertisements across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide. The ads will feature images of the destruction wreaked by the summer bushfire season, with one pointing to the experience of \\u201cone hell of a summer\\u201d and another featuring a koala in burnt bushland. The ads call for the public to support Steggall\\u2019s climate act, making the appeal that \\u201cwhat happens next is up to you\\u201d. The campaign is being funded by community climate change groups, donors of the Climate Act Now campaign and pro-bono assistance, with more than 120 \\u201cClimate Act Now\\u201d advertisements set to appear across the country this month. Steggall is hoping to garner bipartisan support for a national climate change framework bill aimed at transitioning Australia to a decarbonised economy that is based on the UK\\u2019s Climate Change Act, passed in 2008. The bill would put in place national plans for climate change adaption and enshrine a net-zero emissions target by 2050 to be reviewed every five years by a newly established independent climate change commission. Steggall has been arguing that the framework legislation would take the politics out of the climate change policy debate, while putting in place an effective process for national targets, actions and reporting. She has been lobbying both Labor and government MPs to allow a conscience vote on the legislation, and has already locked in the support of the crossbench in the lower house. On Monday, four digital billboards will be in place in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, followed by a rotating poster advertisement campaign across the Sydney CBD and North Sydney, and in Melbourne. Steggall said the campaign was designed to keep the legislation in the public eye, and said there was strong support coming from North Sydney and Wentworth, where moderate Liberal MPs are under pressure to do more on climate change. \\u201cAfter such a horrific summer, this advertising campaign is there to remind Australians that the country needs a sensible approach to climate change,\\u201d Steggall said. \\u201cWe have received enormous support from our neighbouring electorates of Wentworth and North Sydney who want their local federal members to vote for the bill.\\u201d So far more than 73,000 Australians have supported the climate change bill through the \\u201cClimate Act Now\\u201d website. While the bill will be introduced when parliament next sits on 23 March, there is a risk that it will be left to languish on the notice paper without government support. If the government refuses to allow debate on the bill in the House of Representatives after it is introduced, Centre Alliance, which is co-sponsoring the legislation, could introduce it into the Senate later in the year. This would force Labor to declare its hand on the bill, which has so far failed to land a position, saying it will never come to a vote in the lower house. \\u201cFor Zali Steggall\\u2019s bill to be considered, Scott Morrison would need to allow a full debate in the parliament,\\u201d the shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, said last month. As part of the campaign, B-Corp \\u2013 a group that certifies businesses for making positive decisions on the community and the environment \\u2013 will support the bill , backed by 16 of B-corp\\u2019s 300 registered companies.

Stuart Maconie, the writer and broadcaster perhaps best known for his radio work, argues the case for the welfare state and public ownership. To do this he pits himself against those people who like to deride any kind of resistance to the free market as the unwanted intervention of the \\u201cnanny state\\u201d. People, he notes, who tend to have been brought up by \\u201cnannies\\u201d. It\\u2019s certainly a timely subject, given the increasingly polarised debate on the failings of privatisation, but it\\u2019s both too ambitious in scope \\u2013 looking at health, education, housing, transport, the benefits system and even public libraries and parks \\u2013 and too limited in perspective: namely Maconie\\u2019s own, and that of his well-known friends. His teen years were in the 1970s and his basic thesis is that that period was \\u201cthe last Golden Age for the benevolent state and the British working people\\u201d. It\\u2019s an era, he says, that has been traduced by populist historians (all flared trousers and football hooligans) and unfairly remembered for inflation, strikes and power cuts. In fact, he writes, much of this time was \\u201cbloody great\\u201d, and he cites his favourite films, music and literature from the 70s. It sets the scene for a rather nostalgic and sentimental approach to large fiscal, economic and social issues. In this rendering the halcyon days of prog and punk rock, of shining new towns and handsome municipal parks, were brought to a rude end by Margaret Thatcher. Everything went wrong after that. The NHS collapsed, privatisation wrecked the social landscape, and the reform of the benefits system meant no more working-class kids in popular music. \\u201cWhere have all the Erics, Joes, Bills, Georges and Brians gone that formed the rock elite of the 60s and 70s?\\u201d Maconie asks, sounding very much like a man in his late 50s. Perhaps into other forms of music that seem more relevant to them. He complains about the advent of Hugos and Orlandos in indie rock, but fails to mention the Stormzys, Skeptas or Professor Greens of grime and rap. In any case, what\\u2019s taken place since the advent of Thatcherism is a lot more complex than this book allows. Take the NHS. In the glory days of the 1970s, when hospitals were apparently wonderful (and life expectancy was about 73 years), spending on the NHS was between 3% and 4% of GDP. Nowadays (with life expectancy at 81 years) it\\u2019s almost 8%. Could the NHS be better? Very definitely, but not by clinging to a romanticised past, which is where Maconie fixes his rose-tinted glasses. In the closing chapter of the book he visits Norway, which he holds up as an alternative to the British model. He fails to note that healthcare is not free in Norway. Imagine the uproar if a British politician suggested paying for GP visits, as they do in dreamy Norway. Right at the close, Maconie touches on a subject that I suspect was lurking all along beneath his invective: the growing social and political emphasis on individuality and identity. He has a point, in particular when he writes that, for all the ideological talk of self-empowerment, \\u201cthe state is there for you when you do not feel proud or sexy or empowered\\u201d. However, this sometimes charming but ultimately scattershot book is less a critique of the cult of the individual that has flourished in recent decades than a well-meaning example of it. \\u2022 The Nanny State Made Me: A Story of Britain and How to Save It by Stuart Maconie is published by Ebury (\\u00a320).

Now it is to be turned into a TV series by Sister Pictures, makers of the award-winning Chernobyl, with Johan Renck, who directed the Soviet nuclear disaster drama, expected to be at the helm. Rights to Tunnel 29, which are held by the BBC, were fought over in a fierce contest which also involved Neal Street, producers of Sam Mendes\\u2019s 1917 movie, and See-Saw, whose past credits include the Oscar- winning The King\\u2019s Speech.

It\\u2019s interesting that a smaller percentage of people attend arts events and venues in Manchester than in Birmingham or nearby Liverpool. While it\\u2019s good that Burnham has boosted this fund, I wonder if the move was linked to the now postponed mayoral election in early May.

The CPS inspectorate and the government told the Guardian they were unaware of the existence of the report until January 2020. A Guardian investigation has obtained a copy of the unpublished report, which examined 200 unprosecuted rape cases. It found that in the majority of cases prosecutors were overreaching by making \\u201cdisproportionate\\u201d and \\u201cunnecessary\\u201d requests for additional information. However, the Guardian has learned that the CPS did not share its findings with Her Majesty\\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HMCPSI), which was undertaking a review of CPS cases as part of a government review into falling rape prosecution rates. The HMCPSI report was published in December 2019 and offered less stark conclusions than that found by the CPS\\u2019s own secret report. In September last year, the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill, stated that there was a need for \\u201ca frank and full conversation\\u201d about the fall in the number of referrals, charges, prosecutions and convictions of rape. The CPS also stated it was a \\u201cpartner in this review, and will take part honestly and openly to scrutinise and further improve our work\\u201d. However, the CPS has been accused of a lack of transparency after the existence of the internal report was revealed. Vera Baird, the victims\\u2019 commissioner for England and Wales, said: \\u201cThe CPS has promised to be open and frank with those carrying out the government\\u2019s end-to-end rape review. So it is surprising that they did not disclose the very worrying results of this internal review at a time when the inspectorate was specifically examining the whole of the CPS role in rape cases.\\u201d The internal CPS report found: Prosecutors made disproportionate requests in more than half (56%) of administratively finalised cases examined. Almost two-thirds (65%) of rape cases referred by police to the CPS for early investigative advice (EIA) had disproportionate requests for information. Police failed to complete all actions asked for by prosecutors in more than three-quarters of cases (78%). In all cases referred by the police for EIA, they were seeking a decision to drop \\u201cexceptionally weak cases\\u201d. This accounted for a third of all administratively finalised cases. The inspectorate\\u2019s review found prosecutors made disproportionate requests in only 44% of administratively finalised cases. It also found that only 70% of action plans set by the CPS were not met with a proper response by police. Responding to questions from the Guardian, the CPS said it had made HMCPSI aware of its internal report in \\u201cdiscussions\\u201d before the start of its inspection, but had only shared it at the inspectorate\\u2019s request in January. Asked if the HMCPSI was aware of the report when it was carrying out its inspection, the HMCPSI responded: \\u201cNo.\\u201d The internal CPS review, marked \\u201cofficial-sensitive\\u201d, found disproportionate requests included requests for \\u201ca weather report from 1972\\u201d, \\u201cschool reports from the 70s and 80s\\u201d and care home records where there \\u201cwas no indication that these could have or would be relevant\\u201d. The review examined 200 cases that had been \\u201cadministratively finalised\\u201d between October 2018 and March 2019. These are cases the CPS counts as \\u201cclosed\\u201d where police have not responded to requests for further evidence. However, the cases could be reopened at a later date were new evidence provided. The proportion of administratively finalised cases increased from 22% to 29% of all pre-charge decisions made by the CPS between 2017-18 and 2018-19. Other prosecutors had requested \\u201call phone downloads\\u201d and \\u201cCCTV or 999 calls when it was clear there was no such evidence\\u201d. The report said the cases showed \\u201csome evidence that the exact nature of social media \\u2026 was not understood by all prosecutors, for example the request for \\u2018downloads of all Snapchat communication\\u2019.\\u201d In another case, a CPS prosecutor gave police an action plan with 30 actions \\u201cnot specific to the case but a cut and paste set of generic actions\\u201d. These requests had the effect of killing the case, as police did not, or were not able to, meet the demand for information. The report also reveals concerns about police actions. It found almost two-thirds of cases were of \\u201cpoor quality\\u201d, which \\u201cindicates that the police are using the CPS as gatekeepers to quality control their files rather than undertaking proper supervision themselves\\u201d. The report also found police were \\u201cfailing to respond whatsoever\\u201d to appropriate requests for more evidence in 75% of cases. The CPS said the report found no evidence that disproportionate requests contributed to delays. It added that when requests were disproportionate, often they were necessary but prosecutors had failed to set clear parameters. All specialist rape and sexual assault prosecutors had received training to address the issues raised in the internal report, said a spokesperson. Both the CPS and the HMCPSI said the reports had different aims, samples of cases and methodologies. The CPS said it \\u201cwould not have been appropriate to share the report\\u201d and that \\u201croutine assurance work\\u201d was not \\u201croutinely circulated externally\\u201d. In December, the HMCPSI concluded it had found no evidence the CPS was taking a more risk-averse approach \\u2013 a claim not examined in the internal report \\u2013 and charging easier cases to improve its prosecution rate. The CPS said the inspectorate report had provided an \\u201cindependent affirmation of its charging decisions\\u201d. The report was fiercely criticised by victims\\u2019 groups, which accused it of betraying \\u201ca huge lack of curiosity\\u201d about the collapse in rape charging. In a letter to the End Violence Against Women coalition seen by the Guardian, Kevin McGinty, the chief inspector of the HMCPSI, agreed the report was \\u201cincomplete\\u201d and said it had been expedited in order to inform the government review. \\u201cWe were unable to explore matters arising as we went on, or to cover ground we felt needed further work,\\u201d he wrote, adding that the inspectorate had recommended a further joint inspection with the police. The findings of the internal report confirmed the experience of Rape Crisis\\u2019s independent sexual violence advocates, said Katie Russell, a campaigner within the Rape Crisis movement. \\u201cWhat possible reason could the CPS have for effectively sitting on these findings and not even sharing them with the inspectorate?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cWhy would they not want to fully and frankly engage with the ongoing end-to-end review into rape prosecutions which the government has ordered because there is widespread acknowledgement that the current system is failing? That is a question for them to answer.\\u201d Falling prosecution and conviction rates, which are at a 10-year low, prompted the review of the criminal justice system\\u2019s treatment of rape. The number of rape charges have dropped by 51% since 2014, while reported rapes have more than doubled in the same period, from 20,751 to 58,657 in 2018-19. A spokesperson for the attorney general\\u2019s office said: \\u201cImproving how the criminal justice system tackles rape and sexual violence is a priority of this government. A cross-government review into rape and serious sexual offence cases is under way, which will look at a wide range of issues within the system.\\u201d The CPS is also facing a proposed legal case brought by the End Violence Against Women coalition represented by the Centre for Women\\u2019s Justice, who argue that the CPS has unofficially changed its policy and practice in charging rape and has become more risk-averse. A judge will decide on Tuesday whether to grant a judicial review against the CPS.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 1259}, {\"title\": \"Can a face mask stop coronavirus? Covid-19 facts checked\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/can-a-face-mask-stop-coronavirus-covid-19-facts-checked\", \"content\": \"Claim: \\u2018Face masks don\\u2019t work\\u2019 Wearing a face mask is certainly not an iron-clad guarantee that you won\\u2019t get sick \\u2013 viruses can also transmit through the eyes and tiny viral particles, known as aerosols, can penetrate masks. However, masks are effective at capturing droplets, which is a main transmission route of coronavirus, and some studies have estimated a roughly fivefold protection versus no barrier alone (although others have found lower levels of effectiveness). If you are likely to be in close contact with someone infected, a mask cuts the chance of the disease being passed on. If you\\u2019re showing symptoms of coronavirus, or have been diagnosed, wearing a mask can also protect others. So masks are crucial for health and social care workers looking after patients and are also recommended for family members who need to care for someone who is ill \\u2013 ideally both the patient and carer should have a mask. However, masks will probably make little difference if you\\u2019re just walking around town or taking a bus so there is no need to bulk-buy a huge supply. Claim: \\u2018It is mutating into a more deadly strain\\u2019 All viruses accumulate mutations over time and the virus that causes Covid-19 is no different. How widespread different strains of a virus become depends on natural selection \\u2013 the versions that can propagate quickest and replicate effectively in the body will be the most \\u201csuccessful\\u201d. This doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean most dangerous for people though, as viruses that kill people rapidly or make them so sick that they are incapacitated may be less likely to be transmitted. Genetic analysis by Chinese scientists of 103 samples of the virus, taken from patients in Wuhan and other cities, suggests that early on two main strains emerged, designated L and S. Although the L strain appeared to be more prevalent than the S strain (about 70% of the samples belonged to the former), the S branch of the virus was found to be the ancestral version. The team behind this research suggested that this may indicate the L strain is more \\u201caggressive\\u201d, either transmitting more easily or replicating faster inside the body. However, this theory is speculative at this stage \\u2013 there haven\\u2019t yet been direct comparisons to see whether people who catch one version of the virus are more likely to pass it on or suffer more severe symptoms. Claim: \\u2018It is no more dangerous than winter flu\\u2019 Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But this week, a WHO expert suggested that this has not been the case with Covid-19. Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country\\u2019s response, said the evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally. Claim: \\u2018It only kills the elderly, so younger people can relax\\u2019 Most people who are not elderly and do not have underlying health conditions will not become critically ill from Covid-19. But the illness still has a higher chance of leading to serious respiratory symptoms than seasonal flu and there are other at-risk groups \\u2013 health workers, for instance, are more vulnerable because they are likely to have higher exposure to the virus. The actions that young, healthy people take, including reporting symptoms and following quarantine instructions, will have an important role in protecting the most vulnerable in society and in shaping the overall trajectory of the outbreak. Claim: \\u2018You need to be with an infected person for 10 minutes\\u2019 For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer. However, it is possible to be infected with shorter interactions or even by picking the virus up from contaminated surfaces, although this is thought to be a less common route of transmission. Claim: \\u2018A vaccine could be ready within a few months\\u2019 Scientists were quick out of the gates in beginning development of a vaccine for the new coronavirus, helped by the early release of the genetic sequence by Chinese researchers. The development of a viable vaccine continues apace, with several teams now testing candidates in animal experiments. However, the incremental trials required before a commercial vaccine could be rolled out are still a lengthy undertaking \\u2013 and an essential one to ensure that even rare side-effects are spotted. A commercially available vaccine within a year would be quick.\\u2019 Claim: \\u2018If a pandemic is declared, there is nothing more we can do to stop the spread\\u2019 A pandemic is defined as worldwide spread of a new disease \\u2013 but the exact threshold for declaring one is quite vague. In practice, the actions being taken would not change whether or not a pandemic is declared. Containment measures are not simply about eliminating the disease altogether.

It is home to a huge number of rare and endangered species, including breeding wading birds, hares, owls, marsh harriers, water voles, avocets and dragonflies, which hover over and hop between the shallow ponds that riddle this low-lying rural landscape. Elmley is the only nature reserve in the UK where you can actually spend the night. Visitors can choose from one of several overnight options: shepherd\\u2019s huts, a calm, contemporary cottage or a luxurious 18th-century farmhouse. This isn\\u2019t rewilding per se (the manmade landscape is carefully controlled), but a visit to Elmley offers total immersion in a landscape that, 40 years ago, was given over to intensive farming. \\u2022 From \\u00a385 a night, elmleynaturereserve.co.uk Knepp Safaris, West Sussex At 1,400 hectares, Knepp is the biggest rewilding project in lowland Britain. As such, it is well-equipped for visitors eager to discover what\\u2019s happened to the land since the owners, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree, halted decades of intensive farming and returned it to nature in 2001. The estate offers a range of guided nature safaris (by vehicle or on foot), which show the profusion of animals, birds, bats, plants and insects that have flourished here since the disappearance of herbicides and pesticides. There are bell tents, yurts, tree houses and shepherd\\u2019s huts to stay in, or you can pitch your own tent in a wildflower meadow on the edge of an ancient woodland.

Rewilding holidays are organised throughout the year and involve three or four days of tree planting followed by a couple of days spent working in the onsite tree nursery. Volunteers can book individually or as a group and will stay in Dundreggan Lodge, which sleeps 12 and overlooks the river Moriston. The charity has recently announced plans to create the world\\u2019s first rewilding centre in Dundreggan, which is scheduled to open in 2022 alongside new accommodation for up to 40 people.

The 140-hectare site \\u2013 which is in the Cambrian mountains, with far-reaching views towards the sea \\u2013 is an area of open moorland and ancient woodland. Internal fencing is slowly being dismantled, and a herd of wild horses has been introduced to the landscape (their grazing should allow a greater variety of plant species to establish themselves). An ambitious tree-planting project will eventually allow the native woodland to colonise the landscape naturally. There is an annual open day at the nearby historic house, Y Plas, on 18 April, which includes a small exhibition, talks and activities for children, followed by a guided walk of Wildwood.

Johnson looked uncharacteristically grave while the two experts stood expressionless, a choreography that was intended to project a sense of calm, reassuring authority during a national crisis. \\u201cI must level with the British public,\\u201d the Prime Minister said. \\u201cMany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\\u201d While he recognised that the spread of coronavirus now amounted to the \\u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\\u201d, Johnson wanted the UK to know the nation\\u2019s best experts \\u2013 and its politicians \\u2013 were in control of the situation. \\u201cWe have a clear plan,\\u201d he said. Those with persistent coughs or fevers should, from that point on, stay at home for seven days. The elderly would soon be told not to venture out, and families soon be quarantined if one member had a cough. But if the message was clear, it is not obvious that it was shared and agreed by others. When asked whether mass gatherings should be outlawed, the two experts were adamant that this was not necessary, in the short term at least. Banning large crowds would not have a \\u201cbig effect\\u201d on slowing transmission of Covid-19, said Vallance. Indeed, people were more likely to spread the virus watching football in a pub than at an open-air match, however big the crowd. But within a few hours, these calm assurances began to look shaky. The Premier League, Football League and Scottish Football Association announced they were suspending all their seasons until early April. The Wales v Scotland Six Nations Rugby match was also delayed. The government had little option but to follow, and Whitehall sources began briefing that mass gatherings would, after all, be banned from next week. This change of heart was also spurred by some robust interventions from a number of politicians and commentators. Former Tory minister Rory Stewart, who is now hoping to become mayor of London, called for schools to be closed. \\u201cEvidence from other pandemics is that closing schools and large gatherings earlier rather than later stops the peaks of this kind of disease,\\u201d he said. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet, said the government was \\u201cplaying roulette with the public\\u201d, while Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the decision to hold off cancelling large gatherings was \\u201csurprising and concerning\\u201d. Look at Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, said the critics. There, Chinese authorities blocked all outdoor activities and halted the escalation, they argued. And, as the week wore on, and the number of deaths and sufferers across the world grew, more and more senior figures slowly began to question a British approach to coronavirus that began to look out of kilter with the responses of other countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. These criticisms were not just confined to politicians. \\u201cSocial distancing has worked in China, Singapore and other countries,\\u201d said Alan McNally, professor of microbial evolutionary genomics at Birmingham University. \\u201cThere needs to be a combination of social distancing and extensive testing, followed by the quarantining of infected individuals to contain the epidemic \\u2013 and that quarantine should not be at home, where we will see large levels of familial transmission, but in dedicated quarantine facilities.\\u201d Johnson has enjoyed public support for his handling of the crisis so far \\u2013 as our opinion poll shows today, but now appears to be less confident in his strategy. Many experts fear that this poses a serious danger to the UK. They continue to dismiss the idea that Britain should proceed immediately with major shutdowns, maintaining support for carefully controlled interventions. However, in doing so, they expose an alarming schism in the nation\\u2019s attitudes to Covid-19 and the attempts to control it. A clear warning is provided by global health expert Dr Michael Head, of Southampton University. \\u201cThe UK population have significant control over their daily life,\\u201d he said yesterday. \\u201cYou choose when to pop out for a pint of milk or go to a concert. Significant disruptions greatly reduce that control and thus need high population compliance. You won\\u2019t get that over a long period of time. \\u201cPeople already can\\u2019t be trusted to buy toilet roll properly, so how about long-term compliance when significant levels of freedom are removed and there\\u2019s a need to stay indoors for long periods of time? The evidence, as we have it right now, suggests it will decline.\\u201d This point was echoed by Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. \\u201cIt\\u2019s easy to say, \\u2018Let\\u2019s just do what Wuhan did\\u2019, but the actions there have involved a change to daily life that has been unimaginable in scale and impact.\\u201d Measures there included a lockdown on nearly 60 million people in Hubei and strict quarantine and travel restrictions for hundreds of millions of people \\u2013 both citizens and foreigners. \\u201cChina cannot sustain them indefinitely,\\u201d added Kucharski. In addition, the vast majority of the population in Wuhan is likely to remain susceptible to Covid-19, he added. \\u201cAs soon as control measures are lifted, there is the risk of new introduced cases and another outbreak. In addition, countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which for so long have managed to contain Covid-19, now seem to be seeing a rise in transmissions, as infections continue to be introduced.\\u201d Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University agreed. \\u201cIt is now very difficult for those countries that have gone into total lockdown to know under what circumstances they can come out of it. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of those countries has a clear plan \\u2013 an exit strategy \\u2013 through which they can relax their measures.\\u201d Woolhouse added that the World Health Organization \\u2013 which has been pushing for strict lockdown measures across the globe \\u2013 had provided no advice on how these measures could be ended. The lesson for the UK is clear, say experts. Nevertheless, pressure is building on the government to act more forcefully. Yesterday, Labour\\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Observer that public confidence in the government\\u2019s handling of the crisis was fragile and questions were increasingly being posed about key aspects of its strategy. \\u201cDelaying the spread of this virus has to be a priority so as not to overwhelm our already overstretched NHS. But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice. \\u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home, when the World Health Organization recommends continued testing, for example? The government must move into an \\u2018explain\\u2019 phase and publish its modelling, so it can be robustly peer-reviewed. We need total clarity to maintain public confidence.\\u201d In general, Johnson has steered clear of politicising the coronavirus scandal, although the tension between playing politics and managing a national emergency was evident in last week\\u2019s budget. For the first 10 to 15 minutes, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, struck a sombre note as he announced that every financial resource possible would be directed to minimise the coronavirus crisis. After that, however, Sunak turned the event into a pantomime of crowd-pleasing gestures for Tory MPs, which robbed it of the seriousness it merited. Last week, opposition parties \\u2013including Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems \\u2013 began questioning the government\\u2019s approach and raised \\u201cgenuine concerns\\u201d that the UK was not doing as much as other EU countries. And yesterday, a senior Labour source said that there was a gathering sense of unease among MPs that more needed to be done. \\u201cThe political consensus is not going to hold for much longer at this rate,\\u201d said the source.

This point was summed up by medical researcher Michael Head of Southampton University. \\u201cMore stringent interventions will come, and potentially very soon,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe know that. Many people are vocal, saying gung-ho should be the UK response. The usual justification that comes with that is, \\u2018because they\\u2019re doing it over there\\u2019.

Or that millennials are so embittered at how much easier past generations had it that they\\u2019re happy for them to perish. If you perused certain sections of social media, you\\u2019d think we were all busy stockpiling either ageist prejudices or paranoiac visions about the young wishing the old dead. That we\\u2019re truly living in an era of militant ageism. But really, who are these militant ageists \\u2013 does anyone actually know one? It\\u2019s not just the elderly who are vulnerable \\u2013 other groups include those with underlying conditions, disabled people and babies. But it\\u2019s the elderly who have been the butt of gallows humour and worse. Then again, isn\\u2019t this just the online cesspit? Somewhere, doubtless chiselled on a stone tablet, the first rule of the internet states: \\u201cWhatever dost happen, big or small, there will always be a sizable group of people spouting appalling shit about it.\\u201d Online Britain vents \\u2013 it\\u2019s what it does \\u2013 but do such attitudes exist in the real world? Rationally, it\\u2019s unlikely; emotionally, it\\u2019s unthinkable. Older people are not some disposable, abstract concept to younger generations. Most of us have older relatives whom we love. Which explains why, for all the internet yak, I\\u2019ve met a grand total of no one who feels relieved or smug that old people are in danger. On the contrary, people seem extremely concerned about ageing relatives and older neighbours who live alone. In reality, the intergenerational hate we\\u2019re all supposed to be sloshing about in vanishes like the toxic, childish mirage it is. And thank God for that. There is quite enough to worry about without some twist on Logan\\u2019s Run kicking off. The idea of looking to Boris Johnson for answers feels plain weird \\u2013 I\\u2019d be more likely to hunt out the Magic 8-Ball I got from Amazon and give that a good shake. Tactless words have been said and written (talk of \\u201cculls\\u201d of the elderly?). And, naturally, our every own anti-Cassandra, Ann Widdecombe, couldn\\u2019t resist wading in, saying: \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had the scare of Sars, bird flu, Ebola and, of course, Aids. None proved as devastating as feared.\\u201d So around 35 million Aids-related deaths isn\\u2019t devastating? Thanks for letting us know, Ms Widdecombe. So, as always, there\\u2019s tons of stupid going around. Maybe, by now, there\\u2019s even a deepening suspicion among the elderly that the young really would dance on their graves. My advice: don\\u2019t fall for the online hype. Coronavirus is about many things, but it\\u2019s not about ageism. A little more des res: rabbit hutches now with windows Please indulge me in a quick poll: hands up, anybody who\\u2019d love to live in a home with no windows \\u2013 or one the size of a black cab? So, absolutely nobody then. Why do some people think that something they would hate for themselves would be acceptable for others? A loophole has just been closed, which allowed developers to build properties with no windows. Since 2013, they were permitted to convert old corporate or industrial buildings into living spaces without planning permission, so as to boost the supply of available new homes. This resulted in exploitation and substandard homes, many of which had no natural light. One conversion project in London led to 57 new homes with no windows, described by an architect as \\u201cmore like a battery farm than a housing development\\u201d. Moreover, there were no minimum space standards for conversions, and some plans were for homes that were about the size of a London taxi. How could anyone be expected to live humanely in such conditions? This is now being sorted out\\u2009\\u2026ish. The Ministry of Housing has just committed to reforms where all homes built under the permitted development scheme are required to meet standards for natural light. However, nothing was said about the size of homes, while certain pledges \\u2013 such as extending existing buildings upwards by two storeys \\u2013 suggest that hitting Tory targets takes priority. (They promised 300,000 new homes a year, and, last year, produced only 240,000.) That this is being partially and inadequately addressed now doesn\\u2019t justify the past seven years of what appears to be wholesale under-regulated cowboy building. Add to this the general state of the UK\\u2019s rented sector (escalating rents, unacceptable conditions, unscrupulous landlords, insufficient housing benefit), and it is clear that the concept of \\u201cbattery tenants\\u201d is uncomfortably close to the truth. Will Cornwall prove the Moby Dick of Greggs\\u2019 ambitions? Your attention please: Greggs is trying to return to Cornwall, mere months after its sole, short-lived branch was axed in a move dubbed \\u201cGreggxit\\u201d. Greggs intends to open a branch at another site (yet to be determined), and Cornish people are furious, saying they have enough baked goods of their own. This is clearly the main issue facing Britain right now \\u2013 can Greggs finally win over the home of the pasty? But why is this so important to Greggs? The high street chain has enjoyed an astonishing run of late \\u2013 the vegan sausage roll, the fake steak-bake, giving Stormzy his VIP card \\u2013 so can\\u2019t they let it go about Cornwall? Apparently not. The psychology is fascinating, and making me strangely hungry. Maybe there\\u2019s a secret Greggs war-room, with flashing red dots signifying branches all over Britain and just one empty, Greggs-free space (Cornwall)?

It\\u2019s called Hank\\u2019s Hoagies now, in honor of the idiosyncratic Pennsylvania term for a sandwich on a long bread roll, and almost 70 years since Biden left Scranton, his presence lives on \\u2013 in the form of a lifesize cardboard cut out lurking behind the store\\u2019s front door. \\u201cWe love him,\\u201d Tom Owens, the owner of Hanks, said by way of explanation. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a great guy. I think he\\u2019d be a great president.\\u201d Biden\\u2019s dream of becoming president had looked to be over at the end of February. The 77-year-old had lost, by some distance, the first three states of the Democratic primary, was running out of money, and had sagged badly in the polls. Yet Biden won South Carolina, the fourth state to vote, on 6 March with a surprisingly strong showing. Even so, few predicted what came next. Biden won 10 out of the next 14 states, on Super Tuesday picking up more delegates than anyone else. On the less super, but still delegate-heavy, Tuesday that followed, Biden won four out of six states and established a delegate lead that looks unassailable. Speaking after his first big win, Biden seemed as surprised as anyone, and not just because an anti-dairy protester had rushed him on the stage. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!\\u201d Biden told his supporters in Los Angeles. \\u201cTo those who\\u2019ve [been] knocked down, counted out, left behind, this is your campaign,\\u201d he said. \\u201cJust a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared the campaign dead.\\u201d Biden wasn\\u2019t exaggerating. The influential, and frequently accurate, US polling site FiveThirtyEight had given Biden just a one in 12 chance of winning the nomination outright. Bernie Sanders was considered the most likely nominee \\u2013 but not any more. Media coverage has shifted from talk of a contested convention, where neither Biden nor Sanders have enough delegates to win the nomination, to whom Biden will pick as his running mate and what a Biden-Trump election will look like. Meanwhile, the ashes of Sanders\\u2019 campaign are being sifted through to work out what went wrong. Super Tuesday not only handed back Biden the frontrunner status he held for much of 2019 \\u2013 it handed him a big pot of money, too. His campaign said it had raked in $22m in the five days following that vote, a colossal amount considering it took Biden three months to raise $23.2m at the end of 2019. Biden\\u2019s surge has little to do with Pennsylvania, which only votes on 28 April, and much more to do with his strong support among African Americans in the south. Nevertheless, Biden\\u2019s perceived earthy nature, which his Scranton childhood symbolizes, is a big selling point for voters hoping he could win back midwest states from Donald Trump in November. \\u201cHe\\u2019s an honest guy, the kind of guy you respect, which we seem to be lacking a little bit in our leadership now,\\u201d Owens said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s down to earth. I think he\\u2019d be a great president.\\u201d Biden is never shy of leaning into his Scranton background, having visited the city frequently while campaigning for Barack Obama, and Owens said Biden\\u2019s place of birth was visible in his persona. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of blue collar people here. We talk a lot here. We know he has a tendency sometimes to maybe go on a little too much \\u2013 that would be from living around here,\\u201d Owens said. It is, in part, Biden\\u2019s talking that has been a major weakness. He turned in a series of lackluster debate performances through the end of 2019 and into 2020, sometimes stumbling over his words and at times looking like a relic of a bygone era. In the past three weeks alone, Biden has mistakenly claimed: \\u201cTomorrow is Super Thursday\\u201d, on the day before Super Tuesday; stated 125 million people had been shot dead in the US since 2007 \\u2013 the actual figure is less than 500,000 \\u2013 and launched into an expletive-laced row with an auto-worker about \\u201cAR-14\\u201d guns, when a years-long debate has actually taken place over the appropriateness of AR-15 weapons. Donald Trump picked up on Biden\\u2019s gaffes when the president himself appeared in Scranton in the days after Super Tuesday. Appearing at the Scranton Cultural Center \\u2013 on the street where Biden grew up \\u2013 Trump didn\\u2019t hold back just because he was in Biden\\u2019s hometown. Instead, Trump \\u2013 who has faced much scrutiny over his own mental acuity \\u2013 attacked Joe Biden\\u2019s cognitive abilities, listing Biden\\u2019s repeated gaffes and suggesting there is \\u201csomething going on\\u201d with the former vice-president. Biden didn\\u2019t respond to Trump, who wasn\\u2019t appearing in Pennsylvania by accident. Scranton, a town of 77,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania\\u2019s Wyoming Valley, is firmly a part of America\\u2019s rust belt \\u2013 a band of towns and cities stretching nearly a thousand miles from Wisconsin in the west all the way through Pennsylvania in the east. The communities in the rust belt suffered more than most from de-industrialization, as coalmines, steel plants and car factories closed, and some areas still suffer from chronic unemployment. Scranton was once home to the coal industry, and the city and region boomed in the 1930s and 40s, but the decline was just as swift. As the US turned to oil and gas for its energy, mines closed and jobs were lost. Biden and his family moved to Delaware in 1953 after his father struggled to find work in Pennsylvania. The future vice-president became a US senator for the state in 1973. Trump swept into communities like Scranton in 2016, wooing disenchanted working-class voters who had previously voted for Democrats with his hazy promise to Make America Great Again. He won Pennsylvania by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\\u2019s 47.5%, and he narrowly triumphed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, too. In 2020, that means Biden\\u2019s background is a key part of his case to be the Democratic nominee. If he is chosen, it could prove crucial in recapturing those states and the White House. Biden\\u2019s case for being the nominee is based, in part, around his ability to win in the midwest, and he will point to his convincing win in Michigan on Tuesday as supporting evidence. That success in the rust belt was a long time in the making, and came after a concerted effort to make people aware of his upbringing: in the space of two weeks at the end of 2019 Biden was still pumping out shamelessly Scranton-specific advertisements, including \\u201cScranton Values\\u201d and \\u201cA Kid from Scranton\\u201d. In those ads, as in person, Biden looks good for his 77 years. Straight-backed and easily 6ft tall, he looks little different from the decade-old cardboard version of him at Hanks, which apparently is a popular gift. \\u201cI have the same cardboard cut-out. I got it for my mom,\\u201d said Ailish Renton, who was buying a sandwich. \\u201cShe likes him. She also likes the way he looks,\\u201d Renton, 22, said of her mother. \\u201cShe says he\\u2019s very handsome. And that she would kiss him.\\u201d Unfortunately for Biden, few young people share Renton\\u2019s mother\\u2019s enthusiasm. Sanders won 61% of voters under 30 on Super Tuesday, compared with Biden\\u2019s 17%, and also handily beat Biden in the 30-44-year category. Last week, on less-super Tuesday, Sanders won more than 70% of voters under 30 in both Michigan and Missouri. Ironically, given Biden\\u2019s experience is cited by his supporters as a positive that could help him navigate government, it is his longevity that frequently turns off young voters. During his years in the Senate Biden voted for the Iraq war and opposed bussing African American children to predominantly white, better performing, schools, and he supports moderate policies that are anathema to the 18-29 crowd. On Wednesday Sanders said he was staying in the race, and his fervent youth support may be the only thing troubling Biden. Younger people, who already make up a relatively small slice of the electorate, are turning out in lower numbers than in 2016, when Sanders ran Hillary Clinton close, however, and it would take something unprecedented for Sanders to change that in the next few weeks. If Biden can overcome his young people problem, and perhaps even if he can\\u2019t, then he will probably be the Democratic candidate for president. Win the election, and given his frequent visits to Scranton, it is likely the town will experience a visit by a president at some point. Given his affinity with his hometown, however, it\\u2019s likely that even if Biden loses, he will always be welcome in Scranton.

For this is the tale of an unending court case involving the recent sale of a fabulous mansion in one of Britain\\u2019s better known tax havens, home to a man whose rags-to-riches life could have been penned by Charles Dickens. John W Dick was raised in Canada as a Mennonite \\u2013 a Christian sect whose members live humble, God-fearing lives. It\\u2019s a long way from the rarefied world he inhabits now. Today the 82-year-old tycoon rubs shoulders with business titans and political leaders and lives a life of immense luxury. He is a director of media giant Liberty Global, which owns Virgin Media, and an honorary consul for the Rwandan government. Dick \\u2013 tall, bald and charismatic \\u2013 has lived in St John\\u2019s Manor, described as the finest house on Jersey, for more than 40 years. Until recently he was also the Seigneur of St John, a feudal title that carried privileges, including the right to execute servants. But instead of enjoying his twilight years in regal style, the multimillionaire is locked in an extraordinarily messy legal feud with his daughter by his first marriage, Tanya Dick-Stock, and her husband, Darrin Stock, a US businessman. Father v daughter: the claims and counter-claims Few things about the feud are clear. Dick-Stock alleges that her father, abetted by others, has defrauded family trusts \\u2013 offshore vehicles used to protect assets from the taxman \\u2013 of which she is a beneficiary, of tens of millions of pounds. She is also heavily critical of the way the Jersey authorities and its financial services industry have investigated her claims. Dick vigorously disputes his daughter\\u2019s allegations. He regards her and her husband as \\u201cwholly unreliable\\u201d and untrustworthy, citing, among other things, both criticism she received in a Jersey court and the number of court proceedings in which the couple are involved in the US. Dick\\u2019s lawyers also say his daughter does not have the authority to bring the case against her father as the company bringing the action is in receivership, and therefore litigation should be controlled by the receiver. They point out that none of the trusts\\u2019 other beneficiaries, including her own brother, John Dick II, share her views. The entire Dick family, not just Tanya, has been the victim of an audacious fraud, they say. Lawyers for Dick-Stock deny allegations that she is untrustworthy and insist she is entitled to bring a separate personal claim against her father. A spokesman for Dick-Stock said the case was due to be heard on 6 July. This may seem just a story about a wealthy family\\u2019s spectacular implosion in a British Crown Dependency that prizes its independence from the mainland: think Bergerac meets Succession. But the father-daughter battle which, until now, has gone largely unreported, affords a rare glimpse of how the secretive offshore trust system, set up to protect assets from the taxman, can be exploited for fraudulent purposes. Indeed, while there is now almost nothing upon which Dick and his daughter do agree, both believe that a massive fraud has been perpetrated in Jersey, the scale of which has yet to be truly appreciated. Some view the row as a wake-up call for the island. Lurking in the shadows, out of sight of regulators and law enforcement, the offshore trust system appears ripe for manipulation, with beneficiaries often unaware of how their assets are being used. Anonymous trusts that are trustees of other trusts based in different tax havens shuffle money and assets around like cards, using them as security for loans. Frank Casey, the financial analyst who blew the whistle on the Bernie Madoff scandal, drew comparisons between the conditions under which the disgraced financier was able to operate his ponzi scheme and the way the system functions in tax havens around the world. \\u201cThe similarities are really striking,\\u201d Casey said. \\u201cThe basic elements are a lack of transparency and no reportability.\\u201d This in turn raises an important question: if trusts\\u2019 beneficiaries are not always aware of what is happening to their assets, what hope is there for external regulators and law enforcement agencies trying to stop them being used to launder money for kleptocrats, mobsters and drug cartels? The clearest indication that there was trouble in paradise came last month when St John\\u2019s Manor was sold after languishing for two years on the market, the asking price having been slashed from \\u00a322m to a reported \\u00a317.5m. The estate agent\\u2019s sales brochure describes the 11,000 sq ft pile, which dates back to the 14th century, as having \\u201cmagnificent\\u201d landscaped grounds, a \\u201cstunning\\u201d Japanese water garden, stables, a swimming pool, a squash court and a falconry. It also has a chapel where Tanya and Darrin were married and underneath which Dick intends to be buried. Dick-Stock alleges that, down the years, Dick family trusts have had claims over St John\\u2019s Manor as well as other properties including flats in St Petersburg, Jersey and Mayfair, a farm, a fleet of luxury cars and even a vintage doll collection. She also claims to have seen documents that show the trusts once owned a Botticelli painting worth an estimated $20m, a claim categorically denied by her father. But it is the fabulous house that is at the centre of the row. Both father and daughter agree that St John\\u2019s Manor was used to fraudulently secure a \\u00a36.5m loan from HSBC Jersey. It is claimed that a trustee of the Dick family trusts, an obscure offshore services company called PanTrust, played a key role in the alleged fraud before misappropriating the HSBC loan. If true, PanTrust\\u2019s actions run counter to everything a trustee \\u2013 a person or body who has a duty to protect a trust\\u2019s assets \\u2013 is supposed to do, in this case represent the interests of the entire Dick family. The Panama connection and the shady financial adviser But then PanTrust is not your average trustee. The company featured prominently in the Panama Papers, the massive leak of confidential documents from law firm Mossack Fonseca that revealed how hundreds of wealthy individuals and companies had parked their money offshore, in some cases illegally. Banned from operating by the Panamanian regulator in February 2015, PanTrust was found to have set up a complex ponzi scheme in which scores of fake accounts were paying fictitious rates of interest with the results that scores of trusts were fleeced of millions of pounds. The Panamanian regulator also ruled that the firm had failed in its duty to prevent money-laundering and terrorist financing. To this day it has the distinction of being the only company in Panama to ever lose its trust licence. PanTrust was run by a man called Richard Wigley, who managed Dick\\u2019s financial affairs for 30 years until his fraudulent acts were discovered. And it is the relationship between the two men that is now at the centre of the dispute between father and daughter. Was Wigley acting independently of Dick or, as his daughter insists, on his behalf? A Royal Court of Jersey judgment refers to a memo prepared by Wigley which claimed that Dick would receive a share of PanTrust\\u2019s income. But Dick\\u2019s representatives insist that he has never received an income from PanTrust. They say that it was Dick who drew PanTrust to the attention of the Panamanian regulator and that Wigley abused his position and defrauded the Dick family over three decades. It was during court proceedings to have him removed as a trustee that Wigley\\u2019s lawyers made a bombshell admission. They acknowledged that he had created 24 fraudulent loans worth $30m involving a series of trusts set up for the Dick family. Then events took an even more extraordinary turn. According to Dick-Stock\\u2019s legal action against her father, filed in 2018 in the district court, Denver County, Colorado, where one of the family trusts was established, it was only after Wigley had been removed as a trustee that she claims she discovered \\u201cJohn W Dick was not a victim of \\u2026 Wigley, but instead a confederate\\u201d. \\u201cWhen she suspected her father it was like Friday the 13th, when the mask slips and you find out who Jason really is,\\u201d Stock said. To say Dick denies the claim would be a serious understatement. A representative said: \\u201cJohn Dick and his family dispute the entirety of Tanya\\u2019s alternative history.\\u201d Last June, the Dick-Stocks wrote to HSBC Jersey, informing it that the Jersey police and the US authorities had been alerted to allegations that the loan against St John\\u2019s Manor had been secured fraudulently. Dick\\u2019s representatives say they are not aware of any investigations. A spokeswoman for HSBC Jersey said: \\u201cWe can\\u2019t comment due to client confidentiality.\\u201d A team of financial experts hired by Dick-Stock are examining whether other trusts linked to PanTrust \\u2013 and two related trust companies \\u2013 have also been plundered. There are claims that hundreds of millions of pounds may have been looted without the trust beneficiaries being aware of what had happened. Question marks over the whistleblowers It is for this reason that Dick-Stock and her husband present themselves as whistleblowers. They have approached the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) and the island\\u2019s financial crime unit, the JFCU, seeking their help in securing an investigation into the HSBC loan and their wider allegations of fraud, misappropriation and corruption. They claim to have handed over to the island\\u2019s authorities and its police force thousands of pages of documents relating to hundreds of offshore trusts, which would make explosive reading, should they ever become public. But some are sceptical about their allegations and the sceptics have evidence to back their claims. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against the couple, including for unpaid debts. They have also fallen out with their original lawyers and other members of the extended Dick family. Dick-Stock\\u2019s credibility as a witness was also heavily criticised in related proceedings brought in the Royal Court of Jersey. The court said, among other things, the evidence she gave was \\u201cat odds with what she has said on oath to other courts in other places and she has frequently changed her case and evidence\\u201d. It concluded \\u201cwe did not find Tanya\\u2019s evidence reliable nor did we find reliable evidence called on her behalf.\\u201d A spokeswoman for the JFSC confirmed that it was aware of the couple\\u2019s allegations and referred to the judgment above which raises serious questions about Dick-Stock\\u2019s credibility and that of her claim as a whole. The JFSC spokeswoman said: \\u201cIt is important to note that our role, as the regulator, is not to investigate allegations of fraud, as fraud is a criminal offence.\\u201d Compendium: Miami, money laundering and a mafia link It\\u2019s not the first time Dick has found himself up against a family member in a lengthy court case. In the early 90s, while embroiled in divorce proceedings with his second wife, Elizabeth, he was reportedly held in a Jersey prison for 22 days until her alimony payments were resolved. However, in reality he ended up living under house arrest in his mansion for health reasons. The divorce, which was notable for the fact that it took seven years to conclude \\u2013 two years more than the marriage lasted \\u2013 shone light on a secretive Jersey-based trust called Compendium which, it transpired, was the trustee of a John Dick trust. Compendium, the US authorities discovered, had been used by a Miami-based lawyer, Lawrence Freeman, who was indicted for laundering money for the mafia and drug runners. At the time, the court heard suggestions that the Dick family fortune was worth an estimated $1.2bn, a figure Dick\\u2019s representatives now describe as \\u201cwildly inaccurate\\u201d. \\u2018It\\u2019s like launching nuclear bombs. No one will win\\u2019 A copy of the divorce settlement also confirmed that the Dicks listed a Jersey-based company, Sandsend Financial Services, among the assets in which they had a shared financial interest. The company, which was dissolved in 1999, was accused of receiving millions of dollars plundered from US savings and loan firms in the 1980s. The Federal Home Loan Bank Board found that it had received $7m of funds from a looted savings association called Vision Banc \\u201cfor no apparent reason\\u201d. There is no suggestion, nor was there any suggestion at the time, that Dick knew Sandsend or Compendium were being used for illegal purposes. But now, almost 30 years after his high-profile divorce garnered headlines, Dick once again finds himself in the spotlight. Ultimately the family feud, a modern-day Jarndyce v Jarndyce, may end in mutually assured destruction, just as it does in Bleak House, with only the lawyers celebrating. Dick\\u2019s son, John Dick II, foresaw this possibility in a 2017 email he sent himself as a memo. While praising his sister for her \\u201cmiraculous efforts\\u201d in trying to unpick the Dick family\\u2019s tortuous financial problems, he warned \\u201cboth parties have the fiscal and mental fortitude to wage a war against each other but it would be the equivalent of launching nuclear bombs in which case neither party would win. The fallout would destroy what\\u2019s left of the assets as well as greatly impact the lives of everyone around them\\u201d. Not to mention Jersey\\u2019s gilt-edged reputation for protecting the financial interests of the rich and powerful.

All 259 passengers and crew, and 11 Lockerbie residents were killed. Thirteen years later, a Libyan, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, was found guilty of the bombing, and sentenced to life imprisonment. For reasons of international diplomacy, the trial was held not before a Scottish jury but before three Scottish judges in a special court in the Netherlands. Last week, the Scottish criminal cases review commission (SCCRC) referred the case to the appeal court because it \\u201cbelieves that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred\\u201d. It\\u2019s the second time that the SCCRC has referred the case to the appeal court. In 2009, before the previous appeal could be completed, the Scottish government released Megrahi on \\u201ccompassionate grounds\\u201d (he was suffering from prostate cancer). He returned to Libya, where he died in 2012. The case against Megrahi was circumstantial and dubious. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was killed on Flight 103, has devoted his life to unearthing the truth about the bombing, and has long campaigned to prove Megrahi\\u2019s innocence. So has Robert Black, one of Scotland\\u2019s leading jurists, and the man who came up with the idea of a special trial in the Netherlands. Many, including apparently the CIA, have suggested that the evidence pointed to Iranian, not Libyan involvement, possibly through a radical Palestinian cell. Given the horror of the bombing, most people have been happy that someone was convicted, and not worried about the details. But, as Swire and Black bravely attest, truth and justice matter, even, perhaps especially, in a case as terrible as Lockerbie. The appeal may finally throw some light on both. \\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 290}, {\"title\": \"Neurosurgeon Feels Lucky He Was Able To Turn Hobby Into Career\", \"url\": \"https://local.theonion.com/neurosurgeon-feels-lucky-he-was-able-to-turn-hobby-into-1841933012\", \"content\": \"Speaking with reporters about how lucky he feels to be pursuing his life\\u2019s passion full-time, local neurosurgeon Chris Monson said Wednesday he will always be grateful he found a way to turn his favorite hobby into a career.\\u00a0\", \"fake\": \"1\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 38}, {\"title\": \"Mark Zuckerberg Announces All Of Facebook\\u2019s Future Decisions Will Be Made By The Cube Of Justice\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/mark-zuckerberg-announces-all-of-facebook-s-future-deci-1839169061\", \"content\": \"In an effort to put to rest concerns about the direction of the social media giant, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Friday that all of the company\\u2019s future decisions would be made by the Cube Of Justice, which reportedly cannot be questioned nor misled by any mortal means. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve heard your concerns about the content we choose to promote on our platform, and I would like to assure you that The Cube knows all, sees all, and judges all\\u2014it is the ultimate arbiter, and from now on, it will tell us the correct course of action in all situations,\\u201d said Zuckerberg, standing next to the glowing and softly humming object while neglecting to answer any questions about how The Cube Of Justice was made or where it came from. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not up to any one individual, company, or even government to tell us how to navigate the complicated waters of disinformation and free speech.

However, on the basis of China, (and indeed South Korea), where by stringent measures the spread of the virus was halted in its tracks at a relatively low level, massive population spread is not inevitable. We have not been told why such a policy by contrast is not appropriate for the UK. Given the pitifully low level of intensive care unit facilities and trained ICU staff here, it would seem even more critical for our country that the spread of the virus is not merely managed as an epidemiological case study, but stopped before the NHS is completely overwhelmed, as it will be at the levels of infection calmly being predicted by the government and its advisers. The approach looks dangerously like callous complacency rather than urgent emergency intervention. If carnage unfolds, we will look to the experience of other countries, and if we have a significantly higher death rate than others, our government will not be forgiven. Stephen Smith Glasgow \\u2022 The UK government\\u2019s strategy to minimise the impact of Covid-19 \\u201cis to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity\\u201d. Implicit in this is the acceptance of large numbers of deaths of vulnerable people, hence Boris Johnson saying that many families will lose loved ones. This sounds dangerously like what Malthus described in 1798 as \\u201cpositive checks\\u201d, which lead to premature death from disease, starvation and war, resulting in what is called a Malthusian catastrophe. In contrast, nearly every other government in Europe is pursuing a different strategy \\u2013 one of containment. For once, the phrase \\u201cbeing ahead of the curve\\u201d, has deep meaning. Tom Conroy Dublin, Ireland \\u2022 It has long been obvious that Boris Johnson exists in a moral vacuum, but to propose a public policy that tacitly accepts the potential death of thousands of people is beyond shameful and, equally so, to try to minimise its impact as the loss of loved ones before their time. Not only should we question the scientific validity of herd immunity, which the World Health Organization rejects, but also its morality. No wonder the rest of the world is looking with incredulity at the UK government\\u2019s response to Covid-19. Alan Walker Professor of social policy, University of Sheffield \\u2022 There is a reason why doctors take the Hippocratic oath. Now when key decisions on coronavirus are made by politicians, perhaps they should take it too. If herd immunity works, it will be at the cost of avoidable deaths \\u2013 of patients, health workers and doctors. If it doesn\\u2019t work, we will have a social experiment that failed, at the cost of many human lives. Boris Johnson said that \\u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\\u201d. He should have finished his sentence with \\u201cand many of those deaths are avoidable\\u201d. Other countries aren\\u2019t doing this, for good reason. If one of my friends or family die under this policy, I will seriously look at crowdfunding a judicial review. I think we should do everything possible to change this heartless and arrogant approach. Amanda Edwards Velindre, Llandysul \\u2022 Tony Yates quotes Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, as explaining part of the reason for not embracing bans (on gatherings) is to encourage \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d. Surely this is a misinterpretation of what herd immunity is? Before the polio vaccine was developed people got polio. They didn\\u2019t get herd immunity. Herd immunity is predicated on vaccination and it is the vaccinated who constitute the herd, not those with the disease. No vaccine just means more disease, not more immunity. This seems like a dangerous misunderstanding for one in such a pivotal role to make. Dr Andrew Platman GP retired, Beckenham, Kent \\u2022 Your correspondents (Show us the evidence behind Covid-19 policies, Journal, 14 March) are justified in their scepticism of the government\\u2019s response to Covid-19; Boris Johnson and his colleagues haven\\u2019t always been transparent on other matters. However, I do trust the chief medical officer (CMO) and chief scientific adviser (CSA), \\u2013 expert clinician-scientists \\u2013 and they appear to be leading decision-making at the moment. The CMO and CSA are wrestling with complex, contradictory, partial and rapidly-changing data, and formulating recommendations as best they can. Of course, there\\u2019s a debate to be had as to why experts in other countries are initiating more severe restrictions, and more transparency on the modelling information being used would be welcome. More proscriptive actions come with significant risks of their own. For example, closing schools will potentially remove parents employed in health and social care from the workforce at this critical time and/or expose grandparents (the most vulnerable demographic) to risk of increased viral exposure if they take on childcare responsibilities. There is a risk that the government will start to ignore the advice of the CMO and CSA; I do not believe that these two professionals would allow their public health recommendations to be overridden for political expediency. Dr Miles Maxwell Hitchin, Hertfordshire \\u2022 In the last 10 years of Tory control, the NHS has lost 100,000 doctors and nurses and 17,000 beds (Journal, 10 March).

The drink choices, too, are much more flexible. Chocolate eggs may slip down easily with that none-more-Christmassy drink, port, or its French kissing cousins, sweet red fortified wines from Banyuls and Maury in the Roussillon. But if you\\u2019re hosting, nobody\\u2019s expecting you to have a bottle of tawny at the ready in the same way they would if you were bringing the stilton out at Christmas. In other parts of Europe, however, where Easter even now tends to be treated more solemnly or ceremoniously, traditions at the table do seem to be a little more ingrained. In particular, it\\u2019s hard to imagine getting through holy week without at least one meal based around lamb. This is a tradition I\\u2019ve taken, if only because lamb goes so well with so many of my favourite southern European or Mediterranean wines. The specific wine depends on which country or region has provided culinary inspiration. Little lamb chops \\u2013 chuletitas de cordero \\u2013 barbecued over a wood fire? That calls for a mature rioja with tannins as tenderly melt-in-the-mouth as the meat. A Greek recipe for garlicky slow-roast shoulder of lamb with lemon, white wine, thyme, rosemary and oregano? I\\u2019d plump for a Greek xinomavro red, darkly fruited for the full flavours, but puckerishly tart and tannin-ed enough to match the acid in the sauce and cut through the fat of the meat. And for Lebanese lamb shawarma, with an aromatic, sweet and earthy cumin, coriander, and cardamom spicing, then dressed with jewelled sweet-sour pomegranate seeds? It has to be a robust, sweetly spicy, Rh\\u00f4ne-inspired Lebanese red. After the lamb, another southern European-inspired personal tradition: cake and a very specific sweet wine. Like many a beloved food and wine combination, this one\\u2019s the result of a happy memory, in this case of an Easter holiday in Tuscany, where fat, airy slices of colomba pasquale \\u2013 the citrus peel-studded Easter equivalent of panettone \\u2013 were offered at teatime with a glass of sugary nectar scented with vanilla, crystallised oranges and raisins. Made from juice extracted from dried grapes and aged for years in wooden barrels, the wine was vin santo; even for the non-religious what could be more appropriate for holy week?

Perhaps best known for work with the bands Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, P-Orridge, who used s/he as a pronoun, wrote songs about mass murder, mutilation, the occult and fascism. Throbbing Gristle\\u2019s track Zyklon B Zombie was a reference to the poison gas used in the Nazi death camps. Hamburger Lady (from their 1978 album DOA) was inspired by the story of a burns victim. Unstintingly harsh and abrasive, Throbbing Gristle nonetheless built a select but dedicated following. Their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats (1979) \\u2013 an exercise in Germanic electro-pop rather than jazz-funk \\u2013 took them to No 6 on the UK indie chart. Psychic TV, in whose oeuvre a playful pop music sensibility could be discerned, among experiments with electronic noise, psychedelia and droning repetition, seemed to favour subtle infiltration rather than the bludgeoning approach of Throbbing Gristle. They reached 67 on the UK pop chart in 1986 with Godstar, a song about the death of the Rolling Stones\\u2019 Brian Jones. More remarkable was their project, starting in 1986, to record a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months. They managed 14 in 18 months, but this was enough to earn them a Guinness World Records entry. But music was only one of the ways in which P-Orridge channelled their creative energies. Psychic TV made their debut in 1982 at a four-day multimedia event in London and Manchester called the Final Academy, which featured artists including William S Burroughs and Brion Gysin \\u2013 whose cut-up writing technique had been a powerful influence on P-Orridge \\u2013 in a mix of music, literature, film and video. In 1969, P-Orridge had begun laying the groundwork for future explorations by forming COUM Transmissions, a group based in Hull who performed improvised theatre and music shows. They adopted a logo of a partially erect penis, and infused their work with Dada-inspired absurdity. They became successful enough to win grants from the Yorkshire Arts Association, the Arts Council of Great Britain and the British Council, though this did not bring with it a yearning for respectability. Their performances became increasingly extreme, featuring body-cutting and involving P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti (AKA Christine Carol Newby) having sex onstage. In her autobiography Art Sex Music (2017), Fanni Tutti made allegations that P-Orridge had been a violent and manipulative partner, which were denied by P-Orridge. Throbbing Gristle was founded on 3 September 1975 (on the 36th anniversary of Britain declaring war on Germany), comprising Tutti and P-Orridge alongside Chris Carter and Peter Christopherson, and for a time continued alongside COUM. COUM\\u2019s show Prostitution, staged at the ICA in London in 1976, provoked uproar with its pornographic images, sculptures fashioned from used tampons and transvestite security guards, prompting the Scottish Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn to describe P-Orridge and Tutti as \\u201cwreckers of civilisation\\u201d. P-Orridge was born Neil Megson in Longsight, Manchester, the child of Muriel and Ronald Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman, jazz drummer and former actor who had survived Dunkirk with the British Army in 1940. The family moved to Essex, then later to Cheshire, where Neil attended Gatley primary school and won a scholarship to Stockport grammar school. In 1964 Neil was sent to the private Solihull school. There tastes for literature and the avant-garde were developed and Neil became fascinated with the writings of the magician and occultist Aleister Crowley. (In 1981 Neil would form Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth, an association of occultists.) In 1965 Neil founded his first band, Worm, with some school friends. They recorded an album, Early Worm (1968), but only one vinyl copy of it was produced. In 1968, Neil went to Hull University to study social administration and philosophy, but dropped out the following year and moved to London joining the Transmedia Explorations commune in Islington. By the end of 1969 Neil was back in Hull, where COUM Transmissions was developed with John Shapeero. The later phases of P-Orridge\\u2019s life were in some ways the most startling. P-Orridge moved to the US in the 1990s, following allegations (that subsequently proved false) in a Channel 4 Dispatches documentary that s/he had been involved in satanic ritual abuse. In 1993 P-Orridge met Jacqueline Breyer, who was working at a New York S&amp;M dungeon. She adopted the name Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge, and they moved in together in Queens, New York. They married in California in 1995, the year that P-Orridge was badly injured while escaping a fire at the Los Angeles home of the record producer Rick Rubin. He was awarded $1.5m compensation in 1998. The couple set about using plastic surgery to become mirror images of one another, beginning with matching breast implants on Valentine\\u2019s Day 2003, and continuing with work on eyes and nose, liposuction and hormone therapy. They dressed in identical outfits, and P-Orridge coined the term \\u201cpandrogyny\\u201d to express the idea that they fused into a third person, Breyer P-Orridge, who only existed when they were together. P-Orridge subsequently preferred the self-descriptor \\u201cwe\\u201d, though did not object to being called \\u201cs/he\\u201d. This pandrogyny project was cut short when Breyer died of acute heart arrhythmia in 2007, an especially painful loss at a time when P-Orridge was beginning to receive highbrow acclaim. The Invisible-Exports gallery in New York staged a retrospective of their collages, 30 Years of Being Cut Up, and in 2009 Tate Britain purchased their archive. Marie Losier\\u2019s documentary film The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye was released in 2011, and in 2016 the Rubin Museum of Art in New York hosted Try to Altar Everything, an exhibition of P-Orridge\\u2019s paintings, sculptures and installations. In 2018 s/he published Brion Gysin: His Name Was Master, a collection of interviews and essays. In 2003 P-Orridge had unveiled PTV3, a new band drawing on the legacy of Psychic TV.

Yet the disturbing revelations, which involve allegations about the wholesale interception of voicemail messages by three MGN titles, appear to have passed under the mainstream media radar. It\\u2019s as if phone hacking is yesterday\\u2019s story and no one cares any longer to know the truth. Neither newspapers nor broadcasters are giving the matter anything like the kind of attention they once devoted to similar intrusions into privacy by the News of the World (NoW), which led ultimately to that paper\\u2019s closure. But it is time to break the silence. What journalists at the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People did in the early years of this century requires proper public scrutiny. Just as important, arguably more important, is the need to discover why their grubby activities escaped censure and what the MGN board, its legal team and senior managers did, and didn\\u2019t know or do, at the time. A quick bit of history. It was 2006 when the public first learned about hacking by the NoW when the paper\\u2019s royal editor and a freelance \\u201cprivate investigator\\u201d were arrested. Three years later, the Guardian\\u2019s Nick Davies revealed that many hundreds of celebrities had had their phones hacked by the paper. His dogged investigation finally caught the public imagination in 2011 when he told how NoW journalists had hacked into the mobile phone of 13-year-old Milly Dowler, after she had been abducted and subsequently murdered in 2002. At the time, the NoW\\u2019s publisher, Rupert Murdoch, was identified as the villain of the piece for running a company \\u2013 then trading as News International \\u2013 which had allowed staff to use illegal and unethical methods to obtain stories. Plenty of journalists, however, were sure that hacking had not been confined to the NoW. I was among those who received information that similar practices had been carried out by MGN staff. Nor was I alone in raising the allegations in public and asking for comments from the management. The then chief executive, Sly Bailey, asked me for evidence. I replied by suggesting it was she who had the power, and the duty, to hold an internal inquiry. I said the same to the company\\u2019s secretary and legal director, Paul Vickers. He too said there was no proof of hacking. Then BBC2\\u2019s Newsnight ran a segment in which it reported on \\u201croutine phone hacking in the newsroom\\u201d of the Sunday Mirror. I approached Bailey and Vickers once again to ask what they thought of the Newsnight report. I was not alone. Several of the company\\u2019s big shareholders also asked. They responded by ordering what was euphemistically called \\u201ca review of Trinity Mirror\\u2019s editorial controls and procedures\\u201d. Vickers made it clear that it would not amount to an investigation of past activities by its journalists. It was, instead, a comic exercise in corporate face-saving, as was made clear in his evidence to Leveson. He explained that he had written to his group\\u2019s \\u201csenior editorial executives\\u201d to ask whether they had any knowledge about any of their staff having intercepted phone messages. He said: \\u201cAll 44 letters were returned to me signed with no issues raised.\\u201d How did he keep a straight face? When Bailey appeared at the Leveson inquiry, which was set up to consider the culture, practices and ethics of the press, she was questioned about the swirl of MGN hacking rumours. Asked about the claims, she said there was \\u201cno reason to investigate ... unsubstantiated rumours\\u201d, adding \\u201cI have seen no evidence that phone hacking has ever taken place at Trinity Mirror.\\u201d No evidence existed because no editor had been put under pressure.None of the specific allegations had been put to journalists. None of the staff had been asked to come forward to give confidential statements. No internal emails had been monitored. It was the very definition of a whitewash. The following year, MGN received its first tranche of civil claims by people complaining about being hacked. They included the former England football manager, Sven-G\\u00f6ran Eriksson, former footballer Garry Flitcroft, actor Shobna Gulati and Abbie Gibson, the former nanny to David and Victoria Beckham\\u2019s children. All have since settled. At the latest count, 71 claimants are now engaged in legal action against MGN. Not that many people seem to know that. It is doubtful if they know that in January, Mr Justice Mann, a high court judge, spoke of allegations that MGN editors instructed private investigators to obtain information about Milly Dowler as \\u201cserious and inflammatory\\u201d. He was responding to a statement by the barrister, David Sherborne, who is leading a legal team representing the claimants who had spoken of \\u201cwidespread serious misconduct\\u201d by the three Mirror group papers. Similarly, it is doubtful if too many people know that this month, also in the high court, MGN\\u2019s lawyers sought to limit the way in which the alleged hacking victims are hoping to present their case. The claimants are particularly concerned to know whether MGN\\u2019s legal department had been aware of hacking. Mr Justice Mann, in refusing to strike out claims about the legal department\\u2019s knowledge, or lack of it, ruled that they could be aired in court at a future hearing. I am not unsympathetic to the plight of Reach, the company which now runs the MGN titles. The old managers went long ago. Few, if any, of the journalists who were around in the years immediately after 2000, when hacking is alleged to have been rife at the titles, now works for the company. But why does Reach fight on? It has already cost the company more than \\u00a375m to deal with the hacking claims, including settlements. Why does it not settle with claimants and tell them \\u2013 indeed, tell all of us \\u2013 what happened and who was responsible? Many of us know there is a big story to tell about hacking by Mirror group editors and journalists, as big as that which swept the News of the World into the dustbin of history. It is time, surely, for the publisher to come clean.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 13, \"content_len\": 1032}, {\"title\": \"CBS Reveals \\u2018Big Bang Theory\\u2019 Season 12 Will Explore Why Sheldon Keeps Job After Sexually Harassing 6 Research Assistants\", \"url\": \"https://entertainment.theonion.com/cbs-reveals-big-bang-theory-season-12-will-explore-wh-1827981538?utm_content=Main&utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SF\", \"content\": \"As part of a preview of the network\\u2019s fall slate of shows, CBS revealed Monday that season 12 of the long-running sitcom The Big Bang Theory will explore why Sheldon Cooper keeps his job after sexually harassing six research assistants. \\u201cThe story arc, which spans the entire season, shows that while there might be some credibility to the accusations, he\\u2019s far too important for the university to fire him now,\\u201d said Thom Sherman, the network\\u2019s senior executive vice president of programming, explaining that the September 24 season premiere, \\u201cThe Accusation Attenuation,\\u201d featured six graduate students and several corroborating witnesses reporting Cooper for sexual harassment during his tenure as a theoretical physicist, the university\\u2019s investigation into the matter, and its ultimate dismissal of the charges. \\u201cAs the season progresses, the incredibly thoughtful and cautious deans take the allegations extremely seriously before concluding, in the end, that all the women were likely lying.

It\\u2019s ridiculous. \\u201cI\\u2019ve said to my neighbour, who is elderly, that I can pop and get some bits for her.\\u201d Chaotic scenes were also reported across shops in Merseyside as toilet roll, eggs, bread and milk disappeared off the shelves. The Asda store in Smithdown Road in the Wavertree area of Liverpool, opened half an hour after its usual opening time of 10am. Signs on the window explained that \\u201cin order to get as much stock in as possible, the doors won\\u2019t open until 10.30am\\u201d. Other stores ran out of certain products and were unable to restock, with shoppers reporting the Boots in the Edge Lane retail park in the city having no hand sanitiser or hand wash. In Birmingham worried mothers took to social media begging others not to buy supplies of baby milk and formula. One posted on Facebook: \\u201cTo the parent that keeps bulk buying baby milk. You\\u2019re not the only parent with a baby.\\u201d Another wrote: \\u201cWhat happened to people being kind? People are definitely not thinking about others. \\u201cI have enough milk for a little while for my newborn. But once it has gone, it\\u2019s gone. I will have to see what is out there and \\u2026 I have to change his milk either wise which I don\\u2019t want to. \\u201cIt\\u2019s happening to all supermarkets. It\\u2019s a shame.\\u201d Another mother, Francey Siobhan, who needed a thermometer for her child wrote on the Birmingham Mail\\u2019s Facebook page: \\u201cAsda was horrendous! \\u201cAnd looked everywhere for a thermometer for the little one as she isn\\u2019t feeling well and couldn\\u2019t find one.

Aptly, the ballet achieves a potent fusion of two genres: the 19th-century ballet blanc, with its moonlit female apparitions; and Japanese horror cinema, with its lank-haired dead women bringing their unresolved issues to mess with the lives of the living. It doesn\\u2019t hit that spot, though, until the second act. The first takes on rather more than it can manage. The story tells of geishas Okichi (Minju Kang) and her protege Aiko (Sarah Chun), bonded within a patriarchal world. Both take lovers: Okichi the young samurai Takeda (Riku Ito), and Aiko a young American official, Henry (Joseph Taylor). But as geishas they are also subject to other encounters, Aiko to a ceremonial deflowering by the Mayor, and Okichi to first rejection then rape by the American consul-general \\u2013 the former scene, with its dissociated, symbolic style, is much better handled than the more literal latter.

If Kang\\u2019s performance, even as demonic avenger, remains on the demure side, the choreography shifts from dancing out the story to embodying its action \\u2013 in a terrific duet, for example, where Okichi discovers her beyond-the-grave power to puppeteer Takeda\\u2019s body, a waft of her arms making him spin like a maniac. Tindall\\u2019s choreography always rises to its challenges even if it does not always meet them; but this is very much a team piece, with Act 2 as the crucible that alchemises design, story, music and dance into high drama.

Some have gone nearly two months with just a few dozen cases; others have seen an outbreak explode in weeks. The statistics about the early evolution of cases can be confusing, because some countries were slow to test or late to announce results. Italy\\u2019s first case was at the end of January, but the disease is thought to have been circulating there from the middle of the month. Likewise the steep rise of cases in Iran suggests it was spreading long before the first positive test. Many of the countries that have had the greatest success in containing the disease are ones that were affected by Sars in 2002-03. The memory of that crisis may have led to better preparedness, in government and among the population, and to a greater willingness among people to comply with restrictions on movement and daily life to prevent the spread of infection. There are three main aspects to controls that aim to stop the spread of the disease. The first is travel bans on people from areas with high levels of cases (initially mainland China, now many more places); the second is quarantine rules to prevent known or suspected carriers from spreading infection; and the third is shutdowns and social distancing to prevent transmission between unidentified carriers by reducing human contact. Below we take a look at some of the worst-affected countries, and the most successful at containing coronavirus so far. China has not been included, because its circumstances are an outlier. But it is another example of how quarantine requirements, and strict controls on movement and social interaction, can dramatically curb the spread of the disease. On Friday it had only eight new cases, the first time that number has fallen into single digits since the outbreak began. Initially, Italy did little to stop the spread of coronavirus. After it registered more deaths than any other country outside China, and the scale of the crisis became clear, it locked down first the northern region at the centre of the crisis and then the entire country. Schools and universities have closed, along with all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies. Restaurants and bars are closed to customers, although they can make home deliveries. Sports events and outdoor gatherings are banned. Permission is required if travel is vital for medical, work or personal reasons. Iran After announcing the first cases (and deaths) in late February, Iran did nothing about coronavirus \\u2013 perhaps because the government felt it could not afford to offend China, a vital partner for the isolated country. Flights between Iran and China continued, and Iran donated a million face masks to China. Even after the toll began to rise rapidly, and senior politicians tested positive, health workers in small hospitals did not initially use protective gear. Now schools have been closed and most Friday prayer services are cancelled. People have been urged to self-isolate, and the government has warned it may use force to prevent internal travel. The country has dug mass graves to bury the dead. South Korea The country\\u2019s most important tool in fighting coronavirus has been its testing system; South Korea has run far more tests per capita than any other country \\u2013 and nearly 10 times more than in the UK. Many of those tested are members of the Shincheonji religious sect, whose members in Daegu city account for more than half of cases. There are 53 drive-through testing stations, allowing people to check their illness without physical contact. Other measures include cancelling major events, and asking people to stay away from Daegu. The start of a new school term has been delayed from 2 March to the 22nd. Emergency childcare in classes of no more than 10 is offered for those who must go to work. Home working has been encouraged, with subsidies for companies that offer employees the flexibility to manage new care responsibilities. GPS maps, available online to the public, track the movements of anyone confirmed to have the virus. South Korea also screens passengers leaving the country. Widespread testing meant a jump in confirmed cases, currently more than 7,800, but resulted in a very low mortality rate, below 1%. New daily cases are down from a peak two weeks ago, and on Friday the country reported more recoveries than new cases, for the first time since the outbreak began. Taiwan Despite its closeness to China, physically and in economic terms, Taiwan has had extraordinary success in controlling the coronavirus. Efforts may have been helped by the Sars experience, and the fact that the vice-president is an epidemiologist. Taiwan was probably the first country to try to stop coronavirus spreading, bringing in checks on travellers from Wuhan at the end of December, after reports of a mystery, pneumonia-like illness. A command centre for epidemics kicked into action in late January, producing new policies and monitoring virus-tracking and treatment efforts. Wider travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were introduced despite the insistence of the World Health Organization (WHO) that they were not necessary. Extensive testing and contact-tracing through the public health system prevented the disease spreading. School holidays were extended during late February, and schools can be closed again if cases emerge among students. Singapore Travel restrictions on people coming from mainland China were put in place, going beyond WHO advice. An exhaustive testing regime covered anyone with flu-like or pneumonia symptoms. All possible contacts of those infected were tracked, involving the police, flight manifests and a local test for antibodies that circulate after an infection clears. Tests are free, and a huge public information campaign has urged even people with mild symptoms to see a doctor. The government covers medical bills for suspected or confirmed cases, so there are no financial risks to getting tested. Self-employed people get a quarantine allowance, and employers are banned from deducting days in isolation from annual leave. Measures can also be punitive, with one couple prosecuted for providing false travel history. Hong Kong Most border crossings with mainland China have been closed, and people arriving from there must quarantine for 14 days. Schools and universities closed in mid-January, and most remain shut, although a few private schools have partly reopened. Working from home has been encouraged where possible. Museums and sports facilities are shut, and people told to avoid large gatherings. Those with strong memories of Sars have voluntarily stayed home when they can, and used masks and hand sanitiser when they have to go out. The measures have also brought a drop in seasonal flu cases.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 1105}, {\"title\": \"Low by Jeet Thayil review \\u2013 a peculiar high\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/15/low-jeet-thayil-review\", \"content\": \"The work of Jeet Thayil has often been marked by a preoccupation with the dangers and appeal of narcotic oblivion. His first novel, Narcopolis (2012), chronicled life in the opium dens of Mumbai in the 1970s and 80s. His second, The Book of Chocolate Saints (2017), was about a painter who had pursued a perilous life of hedonism to find a sense of creative purity. His latest novel, Low, tells the story of Indian poet Dominic Ullis who, as the book begins, is about to attend the cremation of his wife, Aki, who has fulfilled her lifelong dream of killing herself. He subsequently makes a trip to Mumbai to scatter her ashes, and to find a way to extinguish the afflictions \\u2013 insomnia, anxiety, hepatitis, heroin addiction \\u2013 that have characterised his past. As Ullis puts it: \\u201cThe only thing possible now was oblivion, with the aid of certain powdery or liquid substances.\\u201d Soon, we find him enthusing over a cheap and unsafe new drug known as \\u201cmeow meow\\u201d, which fills the user with a sense of profound disconnection. With his attachment to this drug in place, we follow Ullis around Mumbai for two days. During this time, \\u201ccoming apart in slow motion\\u201d, he lurches around city slums, fretting about the impending destruction of the environment, obsessing over the incompetence of Donald Trump, and encountering an array of untrustworthy addicts who encourage him to navigate \\u201cthe byways and highways of meow\\u201d. The resulting story is often tender and moving, not least when Thayil\\u2019s characters reflect on the nature of suicide and grief. When Ullis recalls Aki talking of her wish for death, the \\u201clow\\u201d that gives the book its title and constitutes \\u201cthe great constant\\u201d of her life, her words have a disarming simplicity: \\u201cAs I grow older, I think about it more and more. I want to die.\\u201d And when Ullis reflects on the nature of bereavement, he does so in a way that registers the intimation of levitational otherworldliness that loss can engender (\\u201cHe felt separated from his body\\u2026 as if he\\u2019d been insufficiently anaesthetised\\u201d). There also also moments of vibrancy and lyricism. When Ullis visits Aki\\u2019s corpse, for example, we are told of \\u201cthe blood vessels that had burst on her cheeks and forehead and neck like scarlet-brown buds that would never bloom\\u201d. Not everything about Thayil\\u2019s creation is successful. Ullis\\u2019s wit often comes across as tawdry sarcasm. And Thayil sometimes diminishes the intensity of his descriptions by slipping into cliche: things are made \\u201cabundantly clear\\u201d; characters have \\u201cnothing to lose\\u201d. On the whole, however, this is a vigorous and enjoyable book that carries the reader along with pace and exuberance.

It may be home to sand lizards and stoats, adders and orchids, butterflies and bush-crickets, water voles, peregrine falcons, or great crested grebes. Yet often these oases are not official nature reserves, but little scraps of land we rarely consider important for nature. Churchyards, roadside verges, railway cuttings and disused quarries may not appear to have much in common. But they were all originally created for humans\\u2019 needs, before becoming places where wild creatures thrive. Together, they add up to an area larger than all our official nature reserves combined. Not that these spots are unimportant to people. Often on the edge of urban areas, they are accessible to more people than rural nature reserves \\u2013 especially to those who, by an accident of birth, background or geography, do not have access to \\u201creal\\u201d countryside. These places also matter for another, even more urgent reason. Since the second world war, a continuous drive towards more intensive farming has turned much of our countryside into a wildlife-free zone. That\\u2019s where the sites featured in this book come in. They provide a much-needed refuge for otherwise scarce species. Without them, some of our most vulnerable wild creatures would already have disappeared. I don\\u2019t need to tell you that Britain\\u2019s wildlife is under threat. Loss of habitat, pollution, persecution and, above all, the global climate emergency, mean that even our once common and widespread species are now struggling. So, at the start of this make-or-break century, as our wildlife enters one of the most challenging periods in its history, I have travelled round the country to visit these unheralded sanctuaries. Without them, nature in modern Britain might not be able to survive at all. Reclaimed docks, Belfast My taxi driver looked puzzled. \\u2018No, fella \\u2013 there\\u2019s nothing down there except an industrial estate. I\\u2019ve never even heard of the \\u201cWindow on Wildlife\\u201d!\\u2019 Fortunately, Google Maps came to our aid, and we headed through the rush-hour traffic towards Belfast docks. Twenty minutes later, we arrived outside \\u201cWoW\\u201d \\u2013 the RSPB\\u2019s Window on Wildlife. The first thing that struck me was the strident calls of black-headed gulls, floating en masse over the lagoon before drifting down to land on artificial nesting rafts. They were accompanied by more delicate, wraith-like birds \\u2013 common and Arctic terns \\u2013 and dozens of black-tailed godwits, feeding voraciously. During the 1960s, when the port was being regularly dredged to permit the passage of large ships, the mud was dumped into three large pools. The plan was that eventually the mud would settle, and the land could then be reclaimed for building. But nature had other ideas. The fertile combination of water and mud created the ideal habitat for waterbirds such as ducks and waders, and they came here to feed in their thousands. Gradually, it became clear that the area was a real hotspot for birds: not just migrants and winter visitors, but breeding species too. Local people began lobbying to save this precious place from development. After long negotiations with the port authorities, the middle of the three lagoons was set aside for wildlife. Back at the visitor centre I had a chat with two regular volunteers, Ken and Phyllis. Ken reflected on the irony that somewhere that looks so natural is entirely created by humans, while Phyllis had noticed that, as the nearby industrial estate and business park grows, more and more workers are dropping in, lured by the sign outside. Belfast WoW is, to be honest, a bit out of the way to attract casual passers-by, as my taxi driver confirmed. But that\\u2019s all the more reason why places like this need championing. Phyllis told me she loves the reaction from visitors when they enter the observation area for the first time. \\u2018They just say, \\u201cWow!\\u201d\\u2019 Brownfield Reserve at Canvey Wick, Essex The southern migrant hawker is one of the most attractive of all our two dozen dragonfly species, and not only because it is so rare. The male is a dazzling cerulean shade, each azure segment interspersed with jet black. Close up, through my zoom lens, I could see the pale blue eyes and the lattice-like wings, laced with tiny shards of gold. This was just one of the amazing insects I saw on a recent visit to Canvey Wick, Britain\\u2019s first \\u201cbrownfield\\u201d nature reserve. It is also home to a plethora of birds such as the whitethroat and stonechat as well as reptiles including adders and common lizards. In the early 1970s, this site was earmarked for an oil refinery, but the oil crisis led to the cancellation of the entire project. Afterwards, it was simply allowed to return to the wild. Had someone wanted to design a nature reserve for insects, they could hardly have done better \\u2013 yet Canvey Wick is perhaps the most genuinely accidental habitat in this book. The poor, sandy soils only allow vegetation to grow slowly, so the wildflowers and grasses are not swamped as they might be elsewhere. And the large, circular stands of asphalt where the oil tanks would have stood built retain heat, creating a microclimate ideal for continental, warmth-loving species such as the shrill carder bee. Then there is the location: Canvey Island is one of the sunniest, warmest and driest places in the whole of the UK. Canvey Wick has been described as \\u201cEngland\\u2019s rainforest\\u201d, but as the Guardian\\u2019s wildlife writer Patrick Barkham pointed out, \\u201cEngland\\u2019s savannah\\u201d is a better description, given the absence of large trees. Like so many other wildlife-rich sites I have visited, it is a mosaic of mini-habitats: birch and willow scrub, brambles, dry and damp reedbeds, long grass and earth banks, which between them create exactly the right mix of ecological niches. Canvey Wick may not look special, but for invertebrate life it rivals well-known nature reserves such as Minsmere, Wicken Fen and Dungeness. As ecologist Dr Sarah Henshall notes, its unusual history gives it a special place in our natural heritage: \\u201cCanvey Wick is wild, it\\u2019s different, it\\u2019s rough around the edges. Wildlife thrives in the untidy messiness \\u2013 that\\u2019s what makes the site unique.\\u201d I am reminded of my childhood, when I played for hours in places like this. Canvey Wick is the clearest possible evidence why the label \\u201cbrownfield site\\u201d is so unhelpful \\u2013 indeed positively detrimental. To those who care about Britain\\u2019s wildlife, it\\u2019s these messy corners that need to be prioritised, not the green swathes of agri-desert that make up so much of our lowland countryside. Gravel pits and reservoirs around London In May 1974, I cycled from my home to the village of Datchet, where the Queen Mother Reservoir was being built. I walked slowly through the heat-haze towards a distant strip of water, where a slim bird took off a few yards in front of me, giving a persistent, high-pitched whistle I now know was a sign of alarm. I lifted my binoculars to see a small, long-winged wader circling low over the gravel. When it landed, I could see the plain, brownish back, black mask and, most importantly, a thin, lemon-yellow eye-ring: my first ever little ringed plover. This was a classic example of a species adapting to an \\u201canalogue habitat\\u201d. On the continent, little ringed plovers nest on the shingle banks of rivers, swept clean of vegetation by winter floods. The bare shingle allows them to disguise their eggs, especially from aerial predators such as kestrels. Gravel pits and reservoirs provided an ideal substitute for riverbanks, and during the post-war years they allowed the little ringed plover to gain a foothold this side of the Channel. About this time, I came across Adventure Lit Their Star, by Kenneth Allsop. The name will be familiar to readers of a certain age, for Allsop was a familiar face on TV during the 1960s. This was a Boys\\u2019 Own adventure story, in which an airman recovering from tuberculosis joins forces with two young lads to foil attempts by an egg-collector to steal a precious clutch of little ringed plovers\\u2019 eggs. The message is that birds need to be protected and welcomed and, more importantly, that nature can offer a form of therapy. This was something Allsop, who had lost a leg in the war and suffered periodic bouts of depression, understood only too well. Little ringed plovers went against expectations to breed in what Allsop described as \\u201cthe messy limbo that is neither town nor country\\u201d. As a definition of the Accidental Countryside, this could hardly be bettered. Peat diggings, Somerset It took me five minutes to walk round. At the edge of the peat diggings a few miles from Glastonbury I saw 10 birds, of just four species. And yet, apart from the five loitering mallards, the others confirmed these changing times. The first bird was a little egret. I am old enough to remember when one of these impossibly white birds made any birding trip a red-letter day. Even now, I still feel a jolt of pleasure whenever I see this little heron, which when I was growing up was still confined to the area around the Mediterranean. Moments later I saw a buzzard, another bird that wouldn\\u2019t have been here 20 years ago. Whereas the little egret extended its range northwards thanks to climate change and habitat restoration, the buzzard benefitted from an end to persecution by gamekeepers, enabling it to recolonise its former haunts. The next bird was one of my favourites: the green sandpiper. I half expected to see it here on this warm, early-August evening, as they drop in to feed on their journey south to Africa. For me, they are the first sign of autumn, despite appearing at the height of summer. The final pair of birds would once have been a very rare sight here. But there are now several dozen great white egrets on the Somerset Levels, and recently they have begun to visit my local patch. Birds like the great white, little and cattle egrets (another recent colonist), give the lie to the idea that all our wildlife is in decline. It\\u2019s not, but it wouldn\\u2019t take much to destroy these temporary, liminal habitats on which so many wild creatures depend. Before I left, I heard the piping call of that lone green sandpiper, and watched it rise into the sky. As it disappeared, I wished it good luck. It would need it, for just as places like this are being destroyed, so its stop-over points are also under threat, from wetlands being drained, or drying up because of climate change. One day, I fear, I will watch one disappear over the horizon, and that will be the last time I ever see a green sandpiper; not just here, but anywhere. Birds are resilient creatures, for sure, but are they resilient enough?

A failure to attract so-called gigafactories to make batteries for electric cars could cost the UK 105,000 jobs by 2040, forecasts by the Faraday Institution show. Carmakers around the world are racing to switch production from internal combustion engines towards electric cars with zero exhaust emissions, amid tightening limits on carbon dioxide output and the threat of outright bans that could come as early as 2032 in the UK. Chinese companies are the main suppliers of lithium ion batteries to European manufacturers, but carmakers are looking to produce their own closer to their factories, meaning billions of pounds of investments are up for grabs, with many UK factories competing directly against their counterparts in France, Germany and Italy. \\u201cOver time, car production will migrate to where the battery production is,\\u201d said Neil Morris, the Faraday Institution\\u2019s chief executive. \\u201cWe\\u2019re at or near the fork in the road.\\u201d If the UK were to build enough batteries to replace fossil fuel car production, direct employment in the automotive industry could rebound from about 170,000 jobs in 2020 to as many as 220,000 in 2040. However, a worst-case outcome with no large-scale UK battery production could lead domestic vehicle producers to \\u201cgradually wind down their production of internal combustion engine vehicles, progressively eliminating the jobs of the 170,000 people directly employed in the UK automotive sector,\\u201d Faraday\\u2019s report says. France and Germany have announced plans for up to \\u20ac6bn (\\u00a35.3bn) of investments in battery production, as they seek to secure employment for millions of workers in their automotive industries. The European commission has also approved a separate plan by Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden to pump \\u20ac3.2bn into starting a European battery industry. The continued uncertainty over Brexit negotiations has further complicated the British government\\u2019s efforts to secure private investment in a gigafactory. Despite the decline of its homegrown industry, the UK has managed to carve out a position as the fourth-largest car producer in Europe. However, all of the UK\\u2019s large factories are owned by foreign companies, many of whom have been averse to making investments until the long-term trading relationship with the EU is decided. The UK\\u2019s departure from the EU was thought by industry insiders to be a factor in Honda\\u2019s decision to close its Swindon factory, as well as Nissan\\u2019s U-turn on building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. The Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port is also under threat from a bad Brexit deal. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said in November that uncertainty over the Brexit process was a key reason for the US electric carmaker\\u2019s choice of Berlin for its first European gigafactory, rather than a UK location. The Society of Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders, which represents UK carmakers, agrees that the industry needs further investment. \\u201cAs the global transition to zero-emission transport gathers pace, we must ensure the UK remains an attractive place to design, build and sell electric vehicles,\\u201d the SMMT said. \\u201cWe already make some of the bestselling electric cars and taxis, but to maintain our manufacturing competitiveness and safeguard jobs for the future demands significant supply chain investment \\u2013 securing large-scale battery manufacturing capability will be essential to driving this.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 14, \"content_len\": 567}, {\"title\": \"UK medical schools urged to fast-track final-year students to help fight coronavirus\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/uk-medical-schools-urged-to-fast-track-final-year-students-to-help-fight-coronavirus\", \"content\": \"UK medical schools have been urged to fast-track qualifications for final-year medical students, waiving requirements for clinical exams and using alternative assessments to enable them to be quickly registered as doctors in order to help tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Medical schools and departments at universities across Britain are facing the prospect of releasing their staff and students to help the NHS cope with the developing crisis. The leadership of the Medical Schools Council (MSC) has advised the UK\\u2019s 42 medical schools that they should prioritise qualifying final-year students even if they have missed clinical exams, so they can be provisionally registered by the General Medical Council (GMC) to begin working as doctors as soon as possible. \\u201cIt is important that medical schools do not delay qualification and so prevent new doctors joining the workforce in the summer,\\u201d the letter from the MSC\\u2019s co-chairs and chief executive said. \\u201cWe suggest that finals are simplified as far as possible, consistent with testing necessary learning objectives. We suggest patients are not used in final clinical exams. Ultimately it may not be possible to deliver any meaningful formal clinical exams, in which case the medical school should review the alternative methods of assessment that are available to them (previous exam results, placement grades etc).\\u201d Clinical teaching and exams using live patients are a crucial part of a medical student\\u2019s education, and the fear is that if clinical work was suspended then this year\\u2019s cohort of final-year students would face delays in qualifying as doctors, at a crucial time for an NHS already facing staff shortages. Students at the University of Cambridge were told last week that the school\\u2019s clinical teaching would end, and that the university had sought approval from the GMC to cancel clinical exams. A spokesperson said the exams would have tied up more than 200 hospital doctors and GPs for more than two weeks, as well as students mingling with large numbers of patients, potentially exposing them to Covid-19 infection. \\u201cI am afraid that we have had to make some extremely difficult decisions, based on the principle that students going in and out of clinical environments could be an unnecessary source of virus transmission, they may be putting their patients and themselves at greater risk, and there may be too few staff available to deliver formal clinical teaching, either through pressure of work or illness,\\u201d students were told in an email from Prof Patrick Maxwell, the head of Cambridge\\u2019s school of clinical medicine. The university said the students have already completed their final written examinations and been assessed on clinical competence in previous exams and placements. Prof Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, has also told staff in an email: \\u201cThe medical science division is cancelling all clinical teaching until further notice in order to release clinical teachers to the wards.\\u201d Meanwhile, University College London has said it will release all clinical academics from their university roles if they want to help the NHS during the coronavirus crisis. \\u201cMany of our clinical academics may shortly be asked to support clinical services as the NHS faces increased pressure during the coronavirus outbreak. We have taken the decision to release colleagues from their UCL responsibilities to enable them to take a decision on this,\\u201d said Prof David Lomas, the university\\u2019s vice provost for health. The MSC said current students should be enabled to work in the NHS during the crisis, by working as call handlers for the NHS\\u2019s 111 telephone service or taking over other non-critical roles to relieve staff. \\u201cWe predict that many medical students who have already passed finals will want to volunteer to work in the NHS and we encourage this. Important principles are that it must be their own decision, they should not be allowed to work beyond their competencies, they should be given full necessary personal protection and full instruction in its use, and they should be fully supervised with clear governance arrangements,\\u201d the letter states. \\u201cOpportunities may be available for post-finals medical students to assist in clinical services other than those dealing directly with patients with coronavirus infection. For example, helping in fracture clinics that are repurposed to deal with patients with minor injuries away from the emergency department environment.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 705}, {\"title\": \"Why do breadwinners treat themselves better than their families? | Torsten Bell\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/inequalty-within-families-gender-pay-gap-lse-study\", \"content\": \"The weather makes it tough, but think about barbecues for a second.

A while ago, the 35-year-old graphic novelist realised that Mervyn King, the erstwhile governor of the Bank of England, shared his name not only with the world\\u2019s fourth-best darts player but also a high-ranking lawn and indoor bowler, whose day job was as a pest controller. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know many famous Mervyns but there were three Mervyn Kings who were, relatively speaking, at the top of their game at the same time,\\u201d says Dooley, his eyes wide with wonder. \\u201cIt was my greatest idea for a comic, which I\\u2019ll almost certainly never do. I thought they could live together \\u2013 all of their correspondence getting mixed up with hilarious consequences. I was going to call it We Three Kings.\\u201d Dooley, who has vivid flame-red hair, glasses and a dense beard, has a weakness for puns. His favourite page of his wonderful, elegiac debut graphic novel, Flake, which is out next month, is one where two characters visit an amusement arcade in a northern seaside town. It\\u2019s called Lancashire Hot Slot. Flake tells the story of two rival ice-cream men: Howard, who is meek and happiest hiding in his van doing the crossword; and Tony Augustus \\u2013 Howard\\u2019s half-brother, as it happens \\u2013 who is intent on building an empire across the region. It is set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Dobbiston, though Dooley admits that it shares much in common with Ormskirk, Lancashire, where he grew up. \\u201cThere\\u2019s something wonderfully optimistic about trying to sell ice-cream in the north of England,\\u201d says Dooley, when we meet at an ice-cream parlour in south London, not far from where he now lives, on a blustery afternoon in late January. \\u201cIt\\u2019s also, I guess, a lonely sort of job. I\\u2019m not going to pretend it is some great allegory for big capitalist companies coming in and taking over the little man. Or it\\u2019s about being an entrepreneur or anything like that. It\\u2019s not. It was an opportunity to make up some ice-creams, which was quite fun.\\u201d This means more puns: Dooley is particularly fond of one of Howard\\u2019s bestsellers, the Lemony Licker. On another page, he has drawn an assortment of designs for ice-cream vans. I compliment him on one named Walt Whipman: \\u201cThanks,\\u201d says Dooley. \\u201cThat\\u2019s very much my favourite one.\\u201d Dooley also clarifies that Flake has no connection with the Glasgow ice-cream wars of the 1980s, where a turf war kicked off between criminal organisations who were selling drugs mainly from the vans. \\u201cI only read about that afterwards,\\u201d he says. \\u201cMine is a bit more gentle.\\u201d Dooley\\u2019s break in comics came in 2016 when he won the Observer/Jonathan Cape/Comica graphic short story prize. His entry was titled Colin Turnbull: A Tall Story, and told the tale of a man whose main ambition in life was to win Lancashire\\u2019s Tallest Milkman competition. There are some clear parallels between the two works: both Colin and Howard are doing jobs that their fathers did before them (and perhaps even their grandfathers before that). They are warm, affectionate, even nostalgic stories of professions and values that are no longer so common. \\u201cThey are the first two parts of the dairy trilogy,\\u201d says Dooley, before clarifying that he\\u2019s joking and he has no immediate plans to return to milk or its by-products as a subject any time soon. Dooley, who spends his weekends playing lawn bowls at Wimbledon Park bowls club, doesn\\u2019t deny that there\\u2019s something of himself in these anachronistic creations. \\u201cI like people or characters \\u2013 and I see this in myself as well \\u2013 who are obsessed by something that other people don\\u2019t care about,\\u201d he says. \\u201cNow, I like ice-cream, and I would not want to say ice-cream is mundane, because it isn\\u2019t. It\\u2019s wonderful. But the inherent naffness of an ice-cream van, the way it\\u2019s painted, it\\u2019s the mix of the absurd and the mundane.\\u201d Previously in the Observer, Dooley was described as a meld of Alan Bennett and the American comic-book artist Chris Ware. He modestly deflects the compliment. \\u201cChris Ware is one of the great visual artists working in any medium,\\u201d says Dooley. \\u201cHe has a meticulous, beautiful style and I have quite a plain, flat style, so it\\u2019s similar in a way. But he\\u2019s much, much better at drawing than I am. And Alan Bennett, he quite likes the mundane and minutiae. But I wince at comparisons like that.\\u201d Despite his protests, Dooley, who fits his drawing around working in the House of Commons in the education department, does share a sensibility with Ware, Bennett and also Tom Gauld. \\u201cMy partner said she struggles to tell the difference in my work between something that is funny and something that is sad,\\u201d says Dooley. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s true; there are lots of bits that could be taken as either. But no, it is ultimately meant to be funny \\u2026 I hope.\\u201d Flake (Jonathan Cape, \\u00a318.99) is published on 2 April\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 833}, {\"title\": \"Climate change forces cognac makers to consider other grape varieties\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/climate-change-forces-cognac-makers-to-consider-other-grape-varieties\", \"content\": \"Cognac makers are considering overturning longstanding tradition and turning to new grape varieties, as the main cultivar required to make the spirit struggles with the effects of global warming. Cognac\\u2019s star grape, Ugni blanc, which accounts for 98% of the vines in the Cognac region, is ripening quicker and losing acidity as summers become hotter and drier. The rules that govern the French brandy are among the strictest in the drinks world, and are subject to controlled appellation of origin (AOC) specifications. Each stage of the spirit\\u2019s production, including the types of grapes that can be used, is outlined in its AOC. Cognac can only be made in one 78,000-hectare area of France, using grapes grown in six regions, or crus. This means distillers cannot move production to another part of the country to escape rising temperatures. The spirit is, broadly, made from wine that is distilled into a liquid called eau-de-vie and aged in oak casks, often for decades. The result is cognac, with Hennessy, Martell, Courvoisier and R\\u00e9my Martin among the best known brands. These brands, and many more, are now working to find sustainable solutions to manage the effects of climate change. Extreme and unpredictable weather has blighted the region: in 2018, powerful hailstorms caused serious damage to 3,500 hectares of vineyards in the Cognac area. Hail and heavy rain also reduced the 2016 harvest, while 2017 was marred by frost. \\u201cThere is more extreme weather in Cognac than there used to be,\\u201d said Patrick Raguenaud, president of the BNIC, the governing body of Cognac. \\u201cWe would sometimes have hail, but not this big.\\u201d The changing climate has also thrown out the timings of production. \\u201cThe grapes are ripening much sooner than they used to,\\u201d said Baptiste Loiseau, cellar master at R\\u00e9my Martin. \\u201cWhat is key is the balance between sugar and acidity. In cognac we need a lot of acidity to maintain the conservation of the wine because we are not using sulphur.\\u201d Winegrowers have shifted harvest dates forward, and Cognac\\u2019s grapes are now removed from their vines in September rather than October. However, this raises concerns that other key flavour characteristics risk being lost. \\u201cWhen we harvest early, we are able to have a correct level of acidity and \\u2026 sugar,\\u201d said Pierre Boyer, deputy cellar master and estate manager at Hine. \\u201cBut the problem is we are going to have less aromatic components in the grapes.\\u201d Cognac houses and their partner winegrowers are seeking longer-term solutions. According to Loiseau, while Ugni blanc has been the best grape variety for Cognac for more than a century, this may not be the case in the coming decades. \\u201cWe have to prepare the future for the next generation, to allow them to take the right decisions depending on the conditions of weather,\\u201d he said. A number of estates across the region, overseen by the BNIC, are testing grape varieties that are not currently permitted under the AOC to see if they prove more resilient to global warming and resistant to disease. R\\u00e9my Martin is working with the Monbadon cultivar and, five years ago, planted vines in test sites. After two harvests, Loiseau notes that the grape\\u2019s ripeness develops at a slower pace than the Ugni blanc vines, which have been planted in an adjacent plot. \\u201cThe role of the trial is to have these two plots and see how they behave year after year, vintage after vintage,\\u201d said Loiseau. Martell, meanwhile, has partnered with the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) to create new cultivars through natural breeding. \\u201cWe have fantastic small new vines, which are quite promising,\\u201d said Pierre Joncourt, vice-president of cognac at Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou\\u00ebt. \\u201cThey are definitely resistant to the disease so far, and they have slower growth.\\u201d Likewise, the BNIC is naturally engineering completely new varieties of grapes with the help of the INRA, using different plants to Martell. \\u201cWe need to prepare as an industry to be resilient and we need to manage long-term actions \\u2013 we need to experiment,\\u201d said Joncourt. \\u201cThen, we need to engage all the stakeholders, all the winegrowers \\u2026 to \\u2026 do something really consistent at a regional level.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 10, \"content_len\": 694}, {\"title\": \"\\u2018The Onion\\u2019 Proudly Stands With The Media As The Enemy Of The People\", \"url\": \"https://www.theonion.com/the-onion-proudly-stands-with-the-media-as-the-enemy-1828068740?utm_medium=SocialMarketing&utm_content=Main&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SF\", \"content\": \"In recent days, President Donald Trump has increased his criticism of the media, and at a briefing Thursday, his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, controversially refused to walk back his statements.

They say the UK is turning its back on strategies that have successfully brought down the numbers of infections and deaths in other countries. On Thursday, Boris Johnson and his medical and scientific advisers announced that only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested. Anyone who had any symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days, without notifying the NHS. Banning mass gatherings would not help reduce the spread of infections, the prime minister and his advisers said \\u2013 although it now seems likely, largely in response to sporting and entertainment bodies cancelling events of their own accord. Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community. \\u201cThe key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance,\\u201d he told the Guardian. \\u201cYou test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community. This deals with family clusters. That\\u2019s the key bedrock of getting this under control.\\u201d This was how South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down. \\u201cYou can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantined. That is vital \\u2013 before you get to social distancing.\\u201d Yet the UK government was stopping tests outside of hospital. \\u201cFor me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just lets rip,\\u201d he said. Costello thinks we will be in the same position as Italy within two weeks. \\u201cThe basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling,\\u201d he said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO\\u2019s director general, expressed his deep concern on Friday at the end of testing and contact tracing in the UK and some other European countries. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t fight a virus if you don\\u2019t know where it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFind, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.\\u201d Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at The University of Edinburgh, listed on Twitter the reasons for continuing to test. \\u201c1 People can alter behaviour based on whether they have Covid. 2 Break chains of transmission. 3 Local hospitals can plan for how many patients will need care. 4 To know where cases are emerging (hotspots). 5 How do we know how large problem is?\\u201d A government minister in Singapore has also expressed dismay. \\u201cOne concern we have with cases such as UK and Switzerland isn\\u2019t just about the numbers. It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,\\u201d minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. \\u201cIf there\\u2019s no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.\\u201d An open letter from a group including some of the UK\\u2019s most senior doctors asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. \\u201cOur country\\u2019s public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries\\u2019 responses globally and in Europe \\u2026 There is also no clear indication that the UK\\u2019s response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,\\u201d it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment. The UK has 2.5 beds per 1,000 people in the population, they said, which is fewer than France (6), Italy (3.2) and the United States (2.8). Immunologists, in a separate open letter, said they had \\u201csignificant questions\\u201d about the government\\u2019s apparent strategy to rely on building up \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d by exposure to the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected. Herd immunity is usually brought about by vaccination \\u2013 not exposing people to the risks of a disease. \\u201cThe ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,\\u201d says the letter from the British Society for Immunology. Behavioural scientists joined the concern, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting \\u201cbehavioural fatigue\\u201d. \\u201cIf \\u2018behavioural fatigue\\u2019 truly represents a key factor in the government\\u2019s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision.

Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the new measures would take effect from midnight, adding the government recommended that those who can work from home or take holidays.

Three cases of coronavirus have been confirmed on the Pacific island of Guam, the second territory in the region to have confirmed cases of the virus. All three confirmed cases are currently in isolation. Preliminary investigation has indicated that all three had travel connections\\u2014two recently traveled to the Philippines and the third had a family member who recently returned from Japan. The Guam department of public health and social services was working to identify people who had been in close contact with the three people over the last 14 days. Guam also declared a state of emergency, including a 14-day suspension of non-essential government operations, school closures, closure of senior citizen centres and self-isolation for people returning from travel. The announcement follows the first confirmed case of Covid-19 in the Pacific region last week, when French Polynesia announced that a politician, Maina Sage, had been diagnosed with the virus. Sage had recently travelled to Paris and had met with France\\u2019s culture minister, who has since been diagnosed with Covid-19. Regional organisations and Pacific governments are preparing for more cases of Covid-19 in the islands region. Many citizens in small island developing states are fearful of the potential stress on medical services. An epidemic of measles across the Pacific last year highlighted the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, adding to existing burdens on public health systems from non-communicable diseases. The leader of one of England\\u2019s leading school chains has broken ranks and called for this summer\\u2019s A-levels and GCSE exams to be scraped until 2021, and for students to repeat the whole school year if necessary. Hamid Patel of the Blackburn-based Star Academies trust says the UK government needs to immediately announce that exams are off the table: Covid-19 is a once-in-a-century pandemic and it requires once-in-a-century responses and solutions to reduce casualties. They may not be the only solutions, but need serious consideration by parliament if we are to avoid students and staff putting their own and others\\u2019 lives at risk because of the allure of high grades or a prestigious university place.

Prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the government had enforcement powers for self-isolation which it would enact if anyone proved reluctant. Anyone arriving from the Pacific Islands is exempt from the restrictions. Meanwhile the country\\u2019s national airline carrier Air New Zealand is slashing 85% of its international flights in the next few months, and has placed itself in a trading halt. Around the country more than 8,000 people are in self-isolation, including three government MPs. Later this week restrictions on mass gatherings are expected to be announced, as well as a financial stimulus package in the billions. Our legal affairs correspondent Owen Bowcott has this from Northern Ireland: Lawyers acting for the mother of a child who has asthma and attends a primary school in County Armagh are planning to launch a judicial review of the Stormont government\\u2019s decision not to close schools in Northern Ireland. Darragh Mackin, a solicitor at Phoenix Law, said that the girl suffers underlying health problems, including severe asthma and is at a greater risk of harm should she contract the coronavirus. He added: \\u201cIt is clear that the respective public bodies have each failed in their respective obligations to our client, and indeed all children, by continuing to require their attendance at school in circumstances in which they would be at an increased risk of contracting the condition. There is no time for any further delay. The necessary policies and decisions all need to be taken in a manner that recognises the real and immediate risk. \\u201cThe wider international community has spoken. Their advice cannot and should not be ignored. \\u201cIt is a deplorable situation when a mother has to initiate urgent legal proceedings to ensure that her child, and indeed children across the jurisdiction, are afforded the necessary protections and safeguards required under law.\\u201d Sam Gelder here. That\\u2019s all from Martin Pengelly reporting on the White House briefing, so I\\u2019m back and will be catching up with the latest from across the world. The anchors are going straight to Trump\\u2019s claim at the top of the press conference that \\u201cwe have tremendous control over\\u201d the virus \\u2013 and then to Dr Anthony Fauci saying, later in the briefing, that \\u201cthe worst is yet ahead of us\\u201d and the response the US manages will determine how bad that \\u201cworst\\u201d will be. Along with reports of clampdowns on social life in California and school closures in New York, and the Fed\\u2019s decision to slash interest rates close to zero, expect plenty of coverage of the president\\u2019s apparent contradiction by his top public health expert. Last question, a White House aide shouts. If it is the last question it is about economic efforts to combat damage from the outbreak and whether enough has been done. Pence says the administration strongly supports the House legislation passed on Saturday and \\u201cno American worker should worry about missing a pay cheque if they\\u2019re feeling ill.\\u201d There are of course gaps and worries and competing corporate interests which will affect the extension of paid leave which the House bill provides. On the economy as a whole, Pence says \\u201cwe\\u2019re in just the first few innings of this effort\\u201d but vital industries will be supported. It\\u2019s vague \\u2013 of course it is. There will be a morning briefing on Monday, Pence says, and a health briefing in the afternoon, and he appeals for Americans to keep up hygiene best practices. He salutes the task force members too, of course. And we\\u2019re out, with a few shouted questions following Pence out of the door. Pence is back up, and asked about the testing process and the work with tech companies including Google and that vexed issue of the diagnostic website. \\u201cAt some point early in the week there will be a website that goes up,\\u201d Pence says, where people can fill out a questionnaire to see if they might have coronavirus. Adm Brett Giroir, assistant health secretary, describes the aims of the website project and the testing. There will be approximately 1.9m tests rolled out to laboratories this week, he says. There\\u2019s no precise timeline but it\\u2019s an \\u201cabsolute priority\\u201d, he says. \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to say that the lab testing issue is over,\\u201d he says, but the focus will now be how to get people actually tested. Pence is asked about possible shortages of hospital beds and ventilators and how the White House is planning to stop Americans \\u201cdying\\u201d and \\u201csuffocating\\u201d. He says he\\u2019ll call on health secretary Alex Azar but pauses first to praise the public-private partnership again. Here\\u2019s former labor secretary Robert Reich on that subject: Azar starts by praising the people on the podium behind him, then says any pandemic \\u201cruns the risk of exceeding our healthcare capacity\\u201d. Which seems obvious. He goes on to outline stockpiling and procedural preparations without mentioning many actual numbers. \\u201cWe have tremendous supplies but we want to acquire more,\\u201d he says, adding that for national security purposes he will not disclose \\u201cconcrete numbers\\u201d of things like, yes, ventilators. A recent Johns Hopkins study suggested the national stock of those was nowhere near enough to cope with what may be coming. Now we\\u2019re on to social distancing \\u2013 and whether a national lockdown might be on the way while the president tells Americans to \\u201crelax\\u201d. Pence hails Trump\\u2019s \\u201cdecisive leadership early on\\u201d, to do with travel restrictions on China and now Europe, the UK and Ireland. Of course he does. He calls on Dr Fauci, who says he meant what he said on the shows this morning about the need for social distancing to be strictly enforced and followed. \\u201cAnything and everything we\\u2019ll consider.\\u201d He is asked for examples. No bars or restaurants? \\u201cCould be, could be.\\u201d He wants the press to let the new guidelines come out tomorrow, then ask questions. Pence is asked about bar and restaurant closings and whether he expects them to spread nationwide, and about the airport customs delays on Saturday night. There will be updated federal guidelines tomorrow, Pence says, but they will defer to state and local authorities. He asks the acting homeland security secretary to address the screening problems at major airports which caused huge queues and no social distancing whatsoever on Saturday night and led Governor Pritzker to say the administration had to \\u201cget its shit together\\u201d. Chad Wolf, the acting secretary, says the lines were \\u201cunacceptable\\u201d and 12 airports saw adjustments to practice but O\\u2019Hare in Chicago did not. Average wait time for screening is now 30 minutes he says, adding that the the process is \\u201cfixed\\u201d. Asked if domestic air travel could be shut down, Wolf says all options are on the table. Dr Anthony Fauci says the \\u201ctesting space available\\u201d is \\u201centering into a new phase\\u201d \\u2013 successive members of the task force are stressing that the administration is doing better on that front, as they would of course be expected to do. \\u201cThe worst is ahead for us,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s how we respond that is going to determine how that endpoint is going to be.\\u201d Now questions. Dr Deborah Birx is up now, explaining how lab work is done in the US and how the US is \\u201cgoing to see a spike in the curve\\u201d as more testing is done and more cases of coronavirus are found. Schools in New York City, meanwhile, were being kept open in part because of the vital social role they play for poorer families, providing full meals and childcare while parents work tough and necessary jobs. That support will still be needed now the schools are closed. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who faced a horrible quandary over the schools which it seems Governor Andrew Cuomo has now solved for him, has announced that there are now five deaths related to coronavirus in the city and 329 confirmed cases. The \\u201cnumber of confirmed cases is moving rapidly\\u201d, though, he says. At the White House they\\u2019re on to task force members describing their work. One would expect the fireworks to start when or if Vice-President Pence takes questions, although they might be smaller rockets and Catherine wheels given his boss has left the room. In New York, it\\u2019s being reported that the public schools have at last been closed, until 20 April at least. Parents of students in the biggest such system in the US now have a major problem on their hands as they themselves are forced to work at home. I know, because I\\u2019m one such parent\\u2026 Here\\u2019s Lois Beckett from Oakland on the latest news out of California: The state of California is \\u201ccalling for the home isolation of all seniors\\u201d aged 65 and over, as well as all people with chronic health conditions, Governor Gavin Newsom said in a press conference on Sunday afternoon. Newsom also said California\\u2019s bars, nightclubs, and wineries must be closed while restaurants may stay open but must reduce capacity by half. Newsom said the state was working on how to make sure that California\\u2019s 5.3m people aged 65 and over, as well as those with chronic conditions, would have access to meals, water and other essentials while in home isolation. Newsom said the new policies were designed to keep the most vulnerable California residents safe during the inevitable surge of coronavirus cases that the state is anticipating in the next week. The state of California has only 11,500 beds in adult and pediatric intensive care units, and only 7,587 ventilators currently in hospitals, Newsom said. These policies, including the closure of all California bars, nightclubs, and wineries, are official guidance, not orders, Newsom said. \\u201cI have every expectation that guidelines will be followed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have the capacity to enforce if necessary.\\u201d Pence goes on, heralding what he calls an \\u201cextraordinary and unprecedented national public-private partnership for diagnostic testing\\u201d. He would say that, of course, but he also praises the bipartisan passage of relief measures by the House on Saturday. Then he says, \\u201cAs the president often says, we are all in this together.\\u201d The US now has more than 2,900 cases in 49 states, Vice-President Mike Pence says as he takes the podium. The risk of serious illness remains low, Pence says, but because the risk is related to the most vulnerable, the administration will continue to urge every American to be vigilant in practising good hygiene and heeding official advice. Pence says he has spoken to Governor JB Pritzker of Illinois, who had harsh words for the administration last night and this morning. Pence riffs extensively about the national day of prayer Trump declared for today, and repeats Trump\\u2019s words about his call with the grocery store executives \\u2013 which will stay open, he says, if possibly with reduced hours. The president and Pence will brief all the governors tomorrow, the VP says \\u2013 \\u201cspecifically about our expanding testing to the American people\\u201d. The lack of testing capability has been a key part of criticism of the administration\\u2019s response. Pence says testing is now available in all 50 states and claims \\u201cunprecedented speed\\u201d in the development of coronavirus testing. He might get questions about that. More than 10 states have their own drive-thru testing sites, Pence says, and he commends them for it, and says \\u201cretail partners\\u201d will work with states. This, we knew too. Trump repeats that he does not want Americans to hoard or panic-buy food supplies \\u2013 they can afford to relax and have a nice dinner, he says. He goes on to thank the task force members crowding the podium behind him, many \\u2013 including Dr Deborah Birx, who Amanda Holpuch profiled here and who had an introduction to bumpy Trump press conferences on Friday. Trump leaves to \\u201cmake some calls\\u201d and does not take questions. US business editor Dominic Rushe has more on the Fed news: In a highly unusual move the Federal Reserve stepped in on Sunday to prop up the US economy in the face of the escalating Covid-19 crisis. The US central bank announced its benchmark interest rate has been cut to near zero and said it would buy $700bn in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities as it attempts to head off a severe slowdown . \\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has harmed communities and disrupted economic activity in many countries, including the United States,\\u201d the Fed\\u2019s rate-setting committee said in a statement Sunday. \\u201cThe Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses.\\u201d Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has been facing intense criticism from Donald Trump over the president\\u2019s perception that he has moved to slow to cut rates. He is set to hold a news conference at 6pm. He starts by saying the Federal Reserve have made him \\u201cvery happy\\u201d by lowering interest rates to 0.25%, which is a story just breaking across the wires. On the subject, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin was on the shows this morning, batting away questions about whether the administration is worried about a coronavirus-enhanced recession. He also thanks Google for \\u201csubstantiating what I said on Friday\\u201d about a website for self-diagnosis of Covid-19, which the press said was inaccurate. Trump claims he was right all along but it still seems Google, or a company related to it, is actually testing its website in the Bay Area of California and not rolling it out nationally. The president also reels off a list of CEOs of grocery and supply chain companies who he spoke to today, about public panic-buying and how to avoid it. Here comes Donald Trump. Speaking of which: As the briefing gets going and Mike Pence likely seeks to offer reassuring words, it\\u2019s worth considering that Dr Anthony Fauci, a very senior Trump administration official, said on CNN this morning that \\u201cYes, it is possible\\u201d thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans could die as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Here\\u2019s more of Fauci: Our job, our challenge is to try and make that not happen. But to think, if we go about our daily lives and not worry about everything, that it\\u2019s not going to happen, it could happen. And it could be worse. To me, that\\u2019s a real impetus to take very seriously the kinds of things \\u2013 I might make a point that people sometimes think that you\\u2019re overreacting. I like it when people are thinking, I\\u2019m overreacting, because that means we\\u2019re doing it just right. Fauci told various morning shows he was in favour of more strict restrictions on social gatherings such as those adopted in Ohio and elsewhere, where bars and restaurants are being closed. It\\u2019s breaking elsewhere that New York governor Andrew Cuomo wants New York City public schools closed this week. They are still open at the moment, unlike such systems in other big cities: Martin Pengelly here in New York, taking over to cover an imminent White House briefing from Vice-President Mike Pence and members of his coronavirus task force. It\\u2019s probably worth pointing out while we wait for the presser to start that the James S Brady Briefing Room, where it will be held, is notoriously not very roomy and thus entirely unsuited to social distancing. When full, the press practically sit in each other\\u2019s laps. Before yesterday\\u2019s briefing members of the press had their temperatures taken and one was turned away. That was the briefing at which Donald Trump revealed that he had taken a coronavirus test, which was later reported to have been negative. There have been a lot of reports about how often Trump and other officials including Dr Anthony Fauci, a top public health official, have touched their faces and shaken hands with each other during recent briefings. Here\\u2019s one. Here\\u2019s some Guardian US coronavirus content to read up on as the briefing begins: Cannabis smokers queued up outside Dutch \\u201ccoffee shops\\u201d on Sunday after the government ordered their closure due to the coronavirus outbreak. Customers lined up in their dozens as they tried to beat a 6pm deadline for the closure of the marijuana cafes and stockpile supplies for what could be weeks of lockdown. \\u201cFor maybe for the next two months we\\u2019re not able to get some weed so it should be nice to at least have some in the house,\\u201d Jonathan, a Dutch buyer, said outside The Point coffee shop in The Hague. The queues built up minutes after the Dutch health and education ministers gave a televised press conference announcing the closure of many businesses, along with all Dutch schools. British horse racing is likely to go behind closed doors from next week, initially until the end of March but potentially for much longer, following a recommendation of the industry\\u2019s Covid-19 working party which will be considered on Monday by racing\\u2019s senior executives.

A British athlete has told the Guardian the International Olympic Committee must act decisively by postponing the Tokyo 2020 Games because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Guy Learmonth, who captained the GB team at the European Indoor Championships last year and is hoping to be picked in the 800m, has become the first British athlete to warn the risks of going to Tokyo in July are not worth it in the current climate. Read the full story here. In the US, Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced on Twitter that all bars and restaurants will close in the state from 9pm on Sunday. The decision comes amid growing pressure for state and city governments to act as the number of coronavirus infections in the US rises. As of Sunday afternoon there were more than 3,000 cases in 49 states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and Washington, DC. Boris Johnson has discussed the coronavirus pandemic with Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. \\u201cThe prime minister spoke to Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman this afternoon about the coronavirus pandemic,\\u201d Downing Street said. \\u201cThe prime minister updated the crown prince on the steps the UK is taking, driven by scientific advice, to tackle the spread of the virus. \\u201cBoth leaders agreed on the need for an internationally co-ordinated response to the outbreak, particularly on developing a vaccine and limiting the economic disruption caused by the pandemic. \\u201cThey resolved to work closely on this, including through the G20 presidency which Saudi Arabia holds this year.\\u201d In Australia, the University of Queensland has has announced it will halt all classes for a week, as the number of Covid-19 infections in the state rise. Vice-chancellor Peter H\\u00f8j announced that all coursework would pause at the Brisbane-based university \\u2013 including in person and online lectures and classes. This comes after the government on Sunday warned against all non-essential static gatherings of 500 people or more. The university has approximately 53,000 student and 2,800 full-time equivalent staff, and is a member of Australia\\u2019s \\u201cGroup of Eight\\u201d, a body of Australia\\u2019s oldest and most prestigious universities. Three students at UQ have so far tested positive for Covid-19. Urban Outfitters announced on Sunday it was closing all of its stores globally until at least 28 March. \\u201cThe health and wellbeing of our community is always our number one priority, from our dedicated staff, partners and suppliers to you, our customer,\\u201d the fashion store said in a statement. \\u201cWith this in mind, we have decided to close all our stores globally.\\u201d Staff will continued to be paid, the company said. Australian Associated Press is reporting that Woolworths, one of Australia\\u2019s two big supermarket chains, will open its doors only to the elderly and disabled for an hour on Tuesday morning. Woolworths will open its doors exclusively to the elderly and people with disabilities for a dedicated shopping hour, after panic buying due to the coronavirus stripped shelves of essentials items. Most of its supermarkets across the nation will open to the vulnerable only from 7am to 8am, beginning on Tuesday. Panic buying in recent weeks sparked by the spread of Covid-19 in Australia has seen supermarkets stripped of toilet paper, pasta and tinned and other dried goods. \\u201cThe move has been prompted by the unprecedented demand in supermarkets over the past week, which has seen many elderly and vulnerable people in the community missing out on vital items they may need when they shop,\\u201d Woolworths announced on Monday. The managing director, Claire Peters, said despite the retailer\\u2019s attempts to quickly restock shelves, many elderly customers had continued to miss out. \\u201cThis temporary measure will give them, and those with a disability, the opportunity to shop before our stores officially open - helping them obtain the essential items they need most in a less crowded environment,\\u201d Peters said. Access will be granted if the shopper has a relevant government issued concession card. All other shoppers will be granted access after 8am. \\u201cNow - more than ever - we need to be kind to each other,\\u201d Peters said. Six care home residents in Scotland have been diagnosed with coronavirus. Highgate Care Home in North Lanarkshire said it had put in place \\u201cstrict infection control measures\\u201d after it identified the positive cases of Covid-19. Staff, residents and their families are being informed. John Kirk, managing director of the care home, said: \\u201cThe health, safety and wellbeing of our residents and colleagues is of paramount importance. As such, we are committed to doing everything we can to keep them safe. \\u201cWe are working closely with all the relevant bodies, including NHS Lanarkshire and Health Protection Scotland, as we implement our comprehensive contingency plan, which includes closing the home to all but absolutely essential visitors, and continuing to take steps to ensure the highest standards of hygiene and infection control.\\u201d France\\u2019s Public Health Authority on Sunday reported there are 36 new deaths from coronavirus, taking the total to 127, and said there had been an increase of more than 1,000 cases. The updated figure follows confirmation earlier on Sunday that the death toll had risen from 91 to 120. The number of cases had risen to 5,423 cases, up from 4,449 on Saturday. A number of schools in Scotland are closing from Monday due to coronavirus outbreaks. Dunblane High School has closed to all pupils and staff after a pupil tested positive for Covid-19. Stirling Council said a deep clean of the school will take place immediately. Isobel Mair School and Nursery in Newton Mearns and Murroes Primary School in Angus have also been closed after the emergence of coronavirus cases linked to their communities. Shetlands Islands Council previously said that some of its schools would be closed for the whole week for \\u201coperational and resilience reasons\\u201d. Scotland has 153 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the latest figures. One person has died after testing positive. Over in Spain police have been fining cyclists, and army specialists in protective suits have been spraying disinfectant in train stations. It comes after the country imposed severe limits on public life and the coronavirus death toll more than doubled overnight. Spaniards, house-bound by law since Saturday, emerged onto balconies and stood at windows on Sunday evening to whoop, cheer and beep horns to salute emergency services dealing with Europe\\u2019s second-worst outbreak after Italy. The government\\u2019s official coronavirus death toll rose by 152 overnight to 288. The number infected rose by 2,000 new cases to 7,753. Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro took selfies with supporters and celebrated the thousands of protestors gathering in major cities on Sunday, just days after he had called for a suspension of the demonstrations due to the spreading coronavirus. Bolsonaro appeared to shrug off the advice of medical experts suggesting he remain isolated after several members of his delegation to Florida recently tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro strode down the ramp of the presidential palace in a Brazilian football shirt and met a throng of his hardcore supporters at the front gate, where he bumped fists, grabbed cell phones to take pictures and leaned in for selfies with the crowd. \\u201cAlthough I suggested (a postponement), I can\\u2019t order anything because this protest isn\\u2019t mine,\\u201d Bolsonaro said. The White House on Sunday urged Americans against \\u201choarding\\u201d as thousands flocked to supermarkets to stock up on essentials, saying US supply chains were strong and leaders were working together to ensure food supplies are available. President Donald Trump held a phone call with more than two dozen grocery store and supply chain executives from across the country, White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. \\u201cThe president reminded the participants that this is an all-of-America approach and each of their stores and the stores they support can help Americans feel calm and safe when shelves are stocked with the items they need,\\u201d Deere said. Luxembourg on Sunday followed its neighbours France and Belgium in closing bars and restaurants to try to stem the spread of the coronavirus epidemic. Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said that, from midnight, bars and restaurants would be closed but grocery shops, pharmacies and other essential businesses could remain open. He called on citizens to limit their movements to travelling to work, food shopping, medical appointments and visits to help the elderly. The over-65s - who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 - were urged to stay at home to reduce the risk of infection. \\u201cThey must cancel their activities and limit what is not essential,\\u201d Bettel said after an emergency meeting of his government. Swimming pools, museums, sports centres, night clubs, libraries and cinemas are also to be closed to try to stop the transmission of the virus. The tiny Grand Duchy has reported 77 cases of the virus and one death so far. France\\u2019s health minister said on Sunday that 120 people had now died from coronavirus in the country, up from 91 on Saturday. Oliver Veran told France 2 television that the number of cases had risen to about 5,400, up from 4,449 on Saturday. Kate Connolly in Berlin reports that the German government has just given more information about its surprise decision to close Germany\\u2019s borders with Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, France and Luxembourg. Interior minister Horst Seehofer said in a press conference in Berlin, the main reason for doing so, from 8am on Monday morning, was to slow down the spread of the virus, which was proving to be \\u201cfast and aggressive\\u201d. The decision was not, as had been widely reported earlier in the day, primarily due to fears that people were driving over the border into Germany and buying up large quantities of the provisions that have been in most demand, and which are cheaper in Germany than in neighbouring countries. There has been concern that such behaviour was in danger of causing social unrest in Germany, as people fear they will be unable to access food and other essentials for daily life in the event of the virus escalating. But today\\u2019s decision, taken after consultation with Angela Merkel, the chancellor, and the leaders of Germany\\u2019s L\\u00e4nder, and announced only after discussions with the leaders of the affected countries, marked an unexpected u-turn in German policy. For days, the health minister Jens Spahn, and Merkel, have separately insisted on several occasions that Germany had no intention of closing its borders, believing to do so would have little impact on the spread of coronavirus. Seehofer said \\u201cWe implicitly ask all citizens to stop undertaking any journeys that are not absolutely necessary.\\u201d He added: \\u201cThe situation is very serious. We must and will react to it accordingly\\u201d. Some 5,813 people have so far been confirmed with coronavirus, according to figures on Sunday evening. The ninth and 10th deaths of people in Germany were announced on Sunday. The new rules would be enforced by border police, Seehofer said. Where there were personnel shortages, border crossings would be closed, he said. German citizens and those with residency permits for Germany, will still have the right to return to Germany, and commuters who criss cross the border for work, will also be able to continue to do so, he said. Pope Francis left Vatican City on Sunday to pray in one of Rome\\u2019s cathedrals for victims of the coronavirus pandemic. The 83-year-old pontiff first visited Rome\\u2019s Santa Maria Maggiore basilica and then walked \\u201con foot, as if on a pilgrimage\\u201d to the San Marcello al Corso church, the Vatican said in a statement. The statement said Pope Francis selected the church because it holds a \\u201cmiraculous crucifix which, in 1522, was carried in procession through the districts of the city\\u201d to mark the end of the Great Plague. The pope prayed for \\u201cthe end of the pandemic that affects Italy and the world, imploring for the healing of the many sick, and remembering the many victims,\\u201d the Vatican said. Iraq has suspended all flights to and from Baghdad airport for a week as of Tuesday, the government said in a statement on Sunday. The government imposed a curfew in the capital Baghdad over the same period earlier in the day. At least 110 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed so far in Iraq, and 10 people have died. More on the news from South Africa from our Africa correspondent Jason Burke: South Africa has declared a national disaster and introduced a series of drastic measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak in the country. In a televised address on Sunday evening, president Cyril Ramaphosa told South Africans that the greatest danger lay in \\u201cfear and ignorance\\u201d. \\u201cNever before in the history of our democracy has South Africa faced such a severe situation,\\u201d Ramaphosa said, as he announced a package of travel bans and additional support to health services. The current total of cases in the country now stands at over 60, with internal transmission of the virus becoming more common. A travel ban will be imposed on flights to and from Italy, Spain, Germany, UK, the US, South Korea, Iran and China from the 18th. Any current visas will be cancelled, Ramaphosa said, and South Africans returning from high risk countries will be placed in self-quarantine In addition, gatherings of more than 100 will be prohibited, schools shut from Wednesday until after Easter and South Africans asked not to travel by any means of public transport. This last measure \\u2013 a request, not an order \\u2013 will effectively immobilise the vast majority of the population who do not own a car. Ramaphosa also described measures to ramp up medical provision \\u2013 a major concern in a country with an under-resourced health service \\u2013 and to protect business from the impact of the shutdown. Tourism is a major earner in South Africa, and significant numbers of jobs are likely to be lost. The flagging economy of South Africa is ill-placed to withstand further strain, with soaring unemployment, a weakening currency and key utilities crippled by debt. Forty new confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. The new cases include 23 males and 17 females. Twenty-five are associated with the east of the country, nine are associated with the west and six are associated with the south. There are now 169 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the Republic and there have been two deaths. South Africa is imposing a travel ban on foreign nationals from the worst affected countries, including Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Germany, the US, the UK and China as of next Wednesday. In an address to the nation, president Cyril Ramaphosa said South African citizens were being advised not to travel to any of those countries, and said any person who has done will be tested and put in self-isolation or quarantine.

On Friday, the Civil Protection provided 250,000 masks for doctors and nurses of Lombardy who refused to wear them citing they were \\u201cuseless\\u201d. The regional authorities compaed them to dust-cloths. \\u201cUnfortunately, we don\\u2019t have a national production of masks,\\u201d the head of civil protection, Angelo Borrelli, told the Sole24Ore newspaper. Italy is running out of masks after the outbreak of the coronavirus. In the country\\u2019s pharmacies, the Fp2 and Fp3 masks are practically impossible to find. Last week, the Guardian visited the open-air market, in Ballar\\u00f2, in Palermo, where some street vendors had set up stalls selling packages containing 14 masks for five euros. From the photographs taken by the Guardian, it can be seen how the masks are the same as those the Civil Protection has provided to Lombardy doctors. The police have already seized thousands of counterfeit masks in Italy, sold for tens of euros each.

A gathering at a mosque in Malaysia that attracted 16,000 attendees has been linked to a major spike in infections in the country, as well as clusters of cases elsewhere. On Sunday, officials in Malaysia confirmed that 190 new patients had been identified, the biggest leap in cases in the country yet, making it the worst-hit nation in Southeast Asia. The majority of the new patients have been linked to the recent religious gathering, which drew people from several countries two weeks ago. Health officials in Malaysia said on Friday that they were working around the clock to conduct mass testing of attendees, while other governments in the region have also urged citizens who were present to monitor for symptoms and get tested. In Brunei, 40 people who traveled to the event are now reported to have the virus, while five attendees in Singapore are also infected. The news prompted the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore to close all mosques for at least five days to limit transmission and allow for cleaning. Thailand has urged citizens who traveled to the gathering to get tested as soon as possible. Indonesia has told hundreds of its citizens who attended to monitor their health and get tested if they are ill. Malaysia has so far managed to identify about 4,900 out of 14,500 citizens who attended the event, according to Bloomberg.

Nick Matthews, from Nailsea, Somerset, reportedly died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the early hours of Saturday. His wife Mary told Nailsea People that he had been taken into hospital with breathing difficulties on Thursday. He was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted to the intensive care unit after showing other signs for coronavirus. She said her husband, who was disabled and unable to work, had previously suffered a heart attack. The couple had recently returned from a holiday in Fuerteventura.

A fugitive boss of the calabrese Mafia was arrested, on Friday, thanks to the lockdown imposed by the Italian government to contain the coronavirus. Cesare Antonio Cord\\u00ec, 42, emerging boss of the Locri clan, in Calabria, has been wanted since last July and accused of fraudulent money transfer. The man was hiding in a villa in the countryside of Locri. The police have been busy, for days, on the checks to enforce the lockdown and the ban on going out, except in cases of extreme necessity. The day before, they stopped a man with shopping bags who justified himself saying he was only bringing the groceries to a friend who could not go out. The police were suspicious of the fact that, in that area, almost all the villas were uninhabited. In the following hours, they followed him and found the shopping was destined for the boss Cord\\u00ec. To arrest him, the intervention of a special military unit was necessary. It consists of elite and highly trained soldiers, known as the Carabinieri Heliborne Squadron, or the Cacciatori, literally: the hunters. According to investigators, Cord\\u00ec is a mobster on the rise in the fierce Locri clan and the subject of a recent investigation by the Calabrian prosecutors. Thousands of citizens have been reported for violating the ban on staying at home, according to data from the Ministry of the Interior. In Sciacca, Sicily, a Covid-19 positive man who was forbidden from going out, was discovered by the police, while shopping. The Prosecutor\\u2019s Office opened an investigation and accused the man of \\u201caiding the epidemic\\u201d. If convicted, he faces 12 years in prison. There is outrage in Brazil this afternoon after the country\\u2019s far-right leader, Jair Bolsonaro, ignored medical advice to leave his presidential palace and greet supporters outside - despite supposedly having been placed in isolation on Friday because he is waiting to take another coronavirus test. At least four close Bolsonaro aides or officials have been diagnosed with the illness since returning from a trip to the US last week and Brazil\\u2019s president is set to take another test next week following confused reports last week that initially suggested he had tested positive for Covid-19. Despite this, Bolsonaro decided to greet and touch supporters on Sunday during controversial anti-democracy protests which he has been promoting. Bolsonaro also tweeted videos and photos egging on pro-Bolsonaro protests across the country - despite the risks of such gatherings given the spread of coronavirus in the South American country. Bolsonaro\\u2019s decision sparked fury among opponents and ordinary citizens who are increasingly alarmed about the spread of coronavirus in Brazil. Major cities including Rio de Janeiro and S\\u00e3o Paulo have begun announcing strict measures such as the closure of schools and cinemas in a bid to contain the crisis. \\u201cPresident Bolsonaro is promoting corona day,\\u201d tweeted Vera Magalh\\u00e3es, a prominent journalist and political commentator. \\u201cBolsonaro must be detained immediately,\\u201d tweeted the rockstar Lob\\u00e3o, a former supporter who has become one of the president\\u2019s most ferocious critics.

People have not had enough of experts after all, writes our columnist John Harris in this comment piece on coronavirus and the politics of polarisation. A package containing suspected counterfeit Covid-19 testing kits arriving from the UK was seized by US customs and border protection at LAX airport. The fake kits had been labelled as \\u201cpurified water vials\\u201d. They have been turned over to the FDA for analysis.

The Spanish government has sparked ire among hairdressers over its decision to allow hair salons to remain open during the nationwide near-lockdown. Spain declared a state of emergency on Saturday, ordering the closure of all non-essential shops as well as bars, restaurants, cafes, football grounds and cinemas. The country\\u2019s 47 million residents have been ordered to stay at home, allowed out only to buy food and medicine or travel to work, health centres or banks. Sources with the Spanish government said the decision to allow hairdressers to remain open was made for hygiene reasons, so as to guarantee services for people with mobility issues who may need help washing their hair. A workers\\u2019 union representing hairdressers in the southern Spanish city of Cordoba launched a Change.org petition on Sunday calling for hairdressers to be shuttered during the lockdown. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t make sense to expose this sector, which has so much contact with the public, to the virus,\\u201d reads the petition. Less than a day after its launch, it had racked up more than 70,000 signatures. Two other associations representing hairdressers said they had advised their members to close during the lockdown in order to avoid any risk of spreading the virus. Germany is set to close its borders with France, Austria and Switzerland from 8am on Monday to try to stem the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, German media reported on Sunday afternoon.

The government has not officially communicated the border closures. The US embassy and the British Foreign Office are also advising their non-resident citizens to leave Argentina quickly while flights are still open. A hotel chain has said it could turn its properties into temporary hospitals if the NHS needs additional bed space during the coronavirus outbreak, PA reports. Best Western Great Britain said it will discuss the move this week and would be willing to take \\u201cunprecedented\\u201d steps to help. The chain, which is the largest independent hotel group in Britain, said it had seen a significant increase in cancellations over the last month due to the outbreak. Rob Paterson, chief executive officer of Best Western Great Britain, said: \\u201cWe are in unprecedented territory so we would be willing to take unprecedented steps to support the national effort. \\u201cIf the NHS wants additional bed space, and we can partner with other companies to provide the right medical equipment and supplies, and we can do it safely, then we would be willing to start having those conversations immediately. \\u201cWhatever we can do to help.\\u201d The National Education Union hastoday asked Ofsted to suspend its inspections of schools in England because of the pressure being placed on teachers by the Covid-19 outbreak. Ofsted has come under fire after the inspectorate said it was \\u201cbusiness as usual\\u201d during the outbreak, and noted existing guidance for inspections in situations where headteachers had died, for which it later apologised. A letter to Amanda Spielman, the chief inspector of schools in England, from the NEU\\u2019s leadership, states: \\u201cWe are very concerned, given the serious challenges that Covid-19 poses for schools, that Ofsted is still planning to conduct inspections.\\u201d The Association of School and College Leaders(ASCL)has also called on Ofsted to halt its regular inspections. Ofsted\\u2019s counterpart in Scotland has already announced that it has suspended school visits. Sean Harford, Ofsted\\u2019s national director of education, told ASCL\\u2019s conference that \\u201cwe will look very favourably\\u201d on all requests to postpone inspections. Any move to halt inspections will need a decision by the government and even an amendment to current legislation that mandates Ofsted to carry out regular inspections. Arts Council England (ACE) has announced details of a three-month coronavirus action plan designed to ensure \\u201cas strong a sector as possible as we come out the other side of this crisis\\u201d. ACE has a \\u00a3622m annual budget supporting England\\u2019s arts organisations \\u2013 including theatres, orchestras, festivals and opera and dance companies \\u2013 as well as individual artists, museums and libraries. All of them will be affected by the escalating coronavirus situation. On Sunday, ACE announced measures that include refocusing some grant programmes to help compensate individual artists and freelancers for lost earnings. \\u201cThis will require further planning,\\u201d ACE said in a statement. \\u201cIt may take about 10 days before we can announce the details.\\u201d It also said funding conditions for the 800-plus national portfolio organisations to which it gives money would be suspended for three months with immediate effect. That means organisations, whether a small fringe theatre or the National Theatre for example, don\\u2019t have to worry about whether they are meeting targets on diversity or achieving goals around the relevance or distinctiveness of their work. The same also applies to projects that get money from ACE\\u2019s creative people and places scheme. \\u201cWe can also advance grant payments to assist with cashflow.\\u201d ACE said the priority was for arts organisations to stay in business. \\u201cIn exchange for our support we ask them to honour contracts agreed with freelancers and artists and to think about what help they can offer their communities. It said the new support was \\u201cjust the start\\u201d and it was \\u201ccollecting intelligence from across the sector so we can understand what is needed.\\u201d Unlike the US and much of Europe, most UK galleries, museums, theatres and concert halls have followed government advice and remained open. That could change quickly. On Saturday, South London Gallery said it was closing until further notice because of the spread of coronavirus \\u201cin order to protect the health and wellbeing of our staff, partners and visitors\\u201d. Organisers of mass event festivals including Glastonbury in June, Edinburgh in August and Hay in May are also ploughing on with plans assuming they will be allowed to take place. Edinburgh international festival has cancelled public launch events due to have taken place on Wednesday in Edinburgh and London. Instead it will announce details of its 2020 programme digitally through Facebook Live. It has also promised to refund in full anyone unable to attend an event because of coronavirus. The Vatican\\u2019s Holy Week ceremonies will go ahead but without public attendance as Italy tries to contain the coronavirus outbreak, the Holy See has said. The UK government is being urged to block-book hotel rooms to enable rough sleepers to self-isolate amid the coronavirus pandemic. Grassroots volunteer network Streets Kitchen and the Museum of Homelessness (MoH) have said hotel bills could be covered by the \\u00a3500m coronavirus hardship fund announced in chancellor Rishi Sunak\\u2019s budget on Wednesday. The MoH tweeted: \\u201cThis would mean people are safer, cross infection rates likely in shared shelter spaces are minimised \\u2026 This plan would reduce hospital admissions and stop people being turfed out of shelters onto the streets and concentrate community efforts.\\u201d The groups said volunteers could deliver food and supplies in a safe and managed way. The call comes more than a week after homelessness charity Crisis raised concerns that the government has no clear strategy in place to protect homeless people from catching the coronavirus. Glass Door, one of London\\u2019s biggest night shelter operators, revealed on Friday it refused to admit a rough sleeper it feared might be carrying the virus amid a lack of guidance. A Public Health England spokeswoman said the advice is being coordinated by the ministry of housing and will be released within days. The British Foreign Office is now advising against all but essential travel to Myanmar due to the risk of quarantine for British nationals arriving in country.

Recent travellers to the US will be put under surveillance for 14 days, while people who have visited China or the Republic of Korea will not be allowed to enter. \\u201cThis list of countries, and the nature of the restrictions, could change without warning,\\u201d the Foreign Office warned. Myanmar has recorded no cases of the coronavirus. A spokesperson for the president\\u2019s office said recently that \\u201cthe lifestyle and diet of Myanmar citizens\\u201d had helped protect the country. Myanmar\\u2019s preference for paper currency over credit cards was also cited as a factor. \\u201c[In other nations] The person handling credit cards at the counter would be in close contact with hundreds of different people in a day. This is avoided by Myanmar\\u2019s predominant use of paper currency,\\u201d U Zaw Htay told a press conference. Bulgaria will ban incoming flights from Italy and Spain as of midnight on 17 March in measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, its transport minister said. Rosen Zheliazkov said on Sunday that Bulgarians who wanted to return home from these countries would have Monday and Tuesday to do so and would face 14 days\\u2019 quarantine. He said the Balkan country, on the gateway between Asia and Europe, will ensure the free transport of goods and escort heavy trucks that need to pass through its territory. The Philippines recorded four more coronavirus deaths and 29 new cases, bringing the domestic tally of infections to 140, as authorities placed the entire capital, Manila, under \\u201ccommunity quarantine\\u201d for about a month beginning on Sunday. The latest deaths include an 86-year-old American male with travel history from the US and South Korea, the Department of Health said in an advisory. The other three are Filipinos, including the latest fatality. In total, 12 people have died from the virus in the country, according to the health department.

One week ago, there were just 589 cases and 10 deaths in the country. The Spanish government has scrambled in the past days to contain the surge in infections, ushering in a near lockdown of its 47 million residents on Saturday. In Wales, 34 more people have tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the country\\u2019s number of confirmed cases to 94. Public Health Wales said it was working with partners in the Welsh government and the wider NHS in Wales now that the country had entered the \\u201cdelay\\u201d phase. Eleven new cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total number of known cases there to 45. The Department of Health said people with mild symptoms \\u2013 new persistent cough and/or fever \\u2013 should stay at home and self-isolate for seven days and that they will not require testing. Argentina is planning a 10-day lockdown with a nationwide quarantine, President Alberto Fern\\u00e1ndez has said in a radio interview. \\u201cEverything that can be done to stop people circulating, better be done,\\u201d the president said. \\u201cIf you can stay at home, stay.\\u201d An official announcement that may include the general self-isolation order and the suspension of classes is expected this evening. Known cases of coronavirus have reached 45, after authorities announced 11 new cases Saturday, the highest day-to-day jump since the crisis began. The new cases include a four-year-old child and a man recently returned from the UK. Two people have died so far. Argentina has closed its main nature tourist attractions, including Argentina\\u2019s side of the Iguaz\\u00fa waterfalls, the largest in the world when combined with their Brazilian side. The falls draw about 5,000 daily visitors this time of year. Argentina last week suspended all flights from the US, UK, Europe, Iran, South Korea, Japan and China and police checks are in place at hotels and the homes of new arrivals to ensure they are obeying the two-week self-isolation period mandated by the government. The Lebanese president Michel Aoun has said his country is in a state of \\u201cmedical emergency\\u201d because of the threat of coronavirus. The president called for citizens to work from home and avoid socialising to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. \\u201cEach of us is called upon to continue his work, from home, in the way he sees appropriate,\\u201d he said in a televised address at the start of a cabinet meeting that was expected to declare measures to deal with the outbreak. Lebanon\\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that it had recorded 99 cases of coronavirus. The University of Law has also temporarily suspended face-to-face teaching. Liverpool John Moores University has suspended all face-to-face teaching for the rest of the semester with immediate effect, as concerns continued to grow about the coronavirus outbreak. The government of Hong Kong will extend compulsory self-quarantine to arrivals who have been to the UK, Ireland, the US and Egypt, regardless of whether they are Hong Kong citizens, as of 19 March. Cyprus has said it will tighten its borders to only allow persons into the country with medical clearance, and place those who do arrive in compulsory quarantine for two weeks to curb the spread of coronavirus. It also announced a suspension in operations of private businesses, including retail stores, nightclubs, hotels and malls. Thousands of Cypriot students abroad would be offered a \\u20ac750 benefit to stay in the country of their study, Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades said. Cyprus has reported 26 coronavirus cases. Iran recorded the highest number of deaths in a single day from coronavirus on Saturday, Iran\\u2019s ministry of health announced on Sunday. The number of people killed in the 24 hours to Saturday lunchtime was 113 people, raising the country\\u2019s death toll to 724. The number of infected people had reached 13,938, a rise of 1,209, a small drop on the size of the previous 24 hour increase. Health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV that 4,590 of those infected had recovered. The figures came as public authorities continued to disagree over measures to stem the flow of new cases. Some of the worst affected areas called for a quarantine of their cities, but the Mayor of Tehran said the measure was not practicable. He has advised all people aged over 60 to stay home, but he is not imposing a closure of shops or offices. Officials are relying on citizens to show self-restraint. A claim by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Friday that they were set to clean the streets, roads and shops over the weekend did not materialise with large numbers still out in Tehran shopping and acting as normal. The army instead started screening drills in a small number of provinces. The President Hassan Rouhani said he opposed curfews, and also rejected plans for fines to be imposed on anyone found to be driving while infected. He said it would be a sufficient punishment to turn people back, and gave the go-ahead for roadside checks in 11 provinces. He also announced a three-month grace period for hard pressed businesses to pay tax, electricity, water and gas bills and banking loans. The death toll remained concentrated with the most 251 dying in the capital Tehran, 84 in Qom city and 143 in Khorazan and 72 in Mazandaran province. The vast majority are aged over 60 or more. On Saturday, cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiee denied all rumours about a lockdown in Tehran. Kate Connolly, our correspondent in Berlin reports that Germany is to close its borders to France, Switzerland and Austria, the government has just announced. 5,072 people were confirmed to have the coronavirus by early afternoon today, with the western state of North Rhine Westphalia, which borders the Netherlands and Belgium, the worst affected area with 2,100 cases. The ninth and 10th deaths from the virus in Germany were announced today. Last week, a German man died in Egypt from the virus. German doctors have warned that they face a personnel shortage, which should be of far greater concern than the oft-cited potential lack of ventilators in case of a mass outbreak. Michael Pfeiffer, president of the German Respiratory Society (DGP), said intensive care wards were already understaffed. He urged decision-makers to train extra staff as a matter of urgency. Uwe Janssens, general secretary of the German Society for ICU Medicine and Emergency Medicine (DIVI), said the recommendations given by the Robert Koch Institute, the leading German public health advisory body, that every medical carer who has been in close, unprotected contact with confirmed coronavirus cases should self-isolate, was \\u201cquite simply not practical\\u201d. Janssens said it could lead to the collapse of Germany\\u2019s health system. In the southern state of Bavaria, which is the third worst affected state, with 681 confirmed cases, local elections are taking place today, despite coronavirus fears, with people advised to bring their own pens, and soap, water and disinfectant on hand for voting station staff. The number of people who chose to vote by postal vote in the last few days, is said to have been considerably higher than in previous years. As authorities ordered the closure of pubs and bars in Berlin, on top of the widespread closure of cultural venues, and all gatherings of 50 people or more, the city\\u2019s police urged the public not to call emergency services if they spotted a venue that had yet to close. \\u201cThe order is still very new and word still needs to get around,\\u201d the police said in a tweet. \\u201cThere is no need to ring our emergency number if you see pubs and bars which are still open.\\u201d Gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned on the island of Montserrat. The government also advised that all schools would be closed from 16 March-3 April, and hospital visits would be restricted until further notice. The action curtailed St Patrick\\u2019s Week festivities and saw other events cancelled. The move came after a passenger on a flight from the UK to Antigua tested positive for Covid-19 and it transpired that more than 80 Montserrat-bound passengers had travelled on the same flight. The passengers have been advised to self-isolate. There are no confirmed cases on the island. Georgia will temporarily shut its border with Russia for travellers from 16 March in a bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the government has said. \\u201cThis decision would not apply accordingly to the citizens of the Russian Federation and Georgia who wish to return to their home country,\\u201d the government said on its website. Restrictions will not apply to freight traffic. The ex-Soviet country of 3.7 million people has 30 cases of coronavirus, the highest number in the South Caucasus region. Earlier this month, Georgia elections officials delayed the state\\u2019s presidential primary set for 24 March until 19 May in an effort to slow the spread of the pandemic. Goldman Sachs Group Inc has confirmed to staff its first two cases of coronavirus, Bloomberg News reports, citing internal memos. The investment bank informed its staff that an employee from its London office had tested positive and was at home in isolation, the report said. The London case followed an earlier memo to staff in its Sydney office that an employee working in its Governor Phillip Tower site had a confirmed case of coronavirus, the report added. Hungary has confirmed its first death of the new coronavirus, state news agency MTI reported. A 75 year-old Hungarian national died shortly after being hospitalised with severe pneumonia and a suspected coronavirus infection. Hungary has 32 confirmed coronavirus cases and 159 people in quarantine, according to government data. The government closed all schools and introduced restrictions on public gathering this week. Thousands of runners have taken part in the Bath Half Marathon, despite concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. Organisers faced calls to postpone or cancel the event, including from Bath\\u2019s MP, they but said it would go ahead as planned. A total of 6,200 runners took part in the 13.1 mile race, about half the usual number expected. Almost 1,000 people joined a Virtual Bath Half group on Facebook instead \\u2013 running the distance in their own communities and posting about it online. Organisers said they had \\u201ccarefully considered, listened and consulted\\u201d before deciding that the it would continue as planned. They said the risk of infection from outdoor events remained low and there was \\u201cno epidemiological or medical evidence\\u201d to suggest it should be restricted. \\u201cEven if we were to cancel at this late stage on the eve of the event, we anticipate that thousands of runners would still turn up to run the route, and we feel we would owe a duty of care to those runners, given that our resources are ready and waiting to support them.\\u201d The move proved controversial after the postponement of other major events, including the London Marathon. Morocco has suspended all international passenger flights to and from its airports as a protective measure against the spread of coronavirus, the foreign ministry said. The country has confirmed 28 cases, including one death and one recovery. Brunei has barred its citizens and foreign residents in the country from leaving the south-east Asian nation due to the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters is reporting. The health ministry said it had confirmed 10 new cases, bringing the tally to 50. Hong Kong has issued a \\u201cred\\u201d travel alert urging people to adjust their plans and avoid non-essential travel to Ireland, Britain and the United States, as the city tries to contain any further outbreak of coronavirus. The government also said members of the public were advised to consider delaying all non-essential travel outside Hong Kong. Equatorial Guinea has reported its first case of coronavirus, a 42-year-old woman who flew back to the capital, Malabo, from Spain on 13 March, the health ministry said in a statement. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan effectively closed their borders on Sunday after Central Asia\\u2019s two biggest nations confirmed their first coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. Kazakh president Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declared a state of emergency, barring entry to Kazakhstan for everyone except returning citizens, diplomats and those invited by the government; Kazakhs are also barred from leaving the country. Uzbekistan announced similar sweeping measures, barring entry for all foreigners and departures by locals. The Tashkent government also closed schools, universities and colleges for three weeks, and cancelled all public events, measures previously announced by Kazakhstan. The Kazakh president\\u2019s decree introduced restrictions \\u2013 without detailing them \\u2013 on the work of large retail trade facilities in addition to the already announced closure of all entertainment venues. Tokayev\\u2019s office said he would address the nation of 19 million on Monday via state television. The emergency is set to last until 15 April. Kazakhstan has confirmed eight coronavirus cases over the last three days, while Uzbekistan, which has a population of 34 million, reported its first case on Sunday, saying it has quarantined 150 people who arrived on the same plane from Paris. Spain is to punish people who fail to comply with the restrictions that have been imposed in response to the coronavirus pandemic. El Pais reported that people could be fined \\u20ac100 euros, and even sentenced to a year in prison if they \\u201cseriously resist or disobey the authorities or their agents in the exercise of their functions \\u201d. People in Spain \\u2013 Europe\\u2019s worst-hit country after Italy \\u2013 have been banned from leaving their homes unless they are buying essential supplies and medicines, or going work, following the deaths of 191 people from the virus. Sportswear giant Nike Inc is set to close all of its stores in the United States and several other countries to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Nike stores in Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand will be closed from March 16 to 27, the company said in a statement. However, Nike-owned stores in South Korea, Japan, most of China and in many other countries are currently open and will continue their normal operations. \\u201cWe are taking additional steps in other Nike-managed facilities, including the option to work from home,\\u201d it added. Earlier this month Nike had temporarily closed its European headquarters in the Netherlands after an employee was infected with the coronavirus. Major sporting events in South Africa are being cancelled as the number of cases there begins to rise steeply. The total has reached 51, 13 more than yesterday. All \\u2013 or almost all \\u2013 appear to be individuals who have recently returned from travel to Europe or other badly hit places. This has been the pattern across most of the continent, where numbers of confirmed cases overall remain negligible compared to elsewhere. Kenya, which has significant commercial ties with China and Europe, announced its first case late last week. However, the pandemic is still having a major effect. Among sporting events in South Africa that have been cancelled in recent days include the Two Oceans ultra marathon in Cape Town, which was set to take place early next month. There are widespread fears that weak and under-resourced health systems across the continent will have difficulty coping with large numbers of seriously ill people. Ventilators and other critical equipment are in extremely short supply in many countries. When I heard about Britain\\u2019s \\u2018herd immunity\\u2019 coronavirus plan, I thought it was satire, writes Dr William Hanage, a professor of the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard. The most fundamental function of a government is to keep its people safe. It is from this that it derives its authority, the confidence of the people and its legitimacy. Nobody should be under the illusion that this is something that can be dodged through somehow manipulating a virus that we are only beginning to understand. This will not pass you by; this is not a tornado, it is a hurricane. More than \\u20ac4m has been raised in Italy from hundreds of campaigns within 24 hours to help those at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, GoFundMe said. This is the largest fundraising effort we\\u2019ve seen on GoFundMe in Europe to date, with hundreds of campaigns raising more than \\u20ac4m in just 24 hours. What Italy is going through is incredibly difficult but it\\u2019s amazing to see people in Italy, Europe and across the globe come together to help. Universities Scotland has said in a statement that the country\\u2019s higher education institutions will remain open \\u2013 subject to expert advice \\u2013 but that teaching and assessments will shift online. Universities have no plans to close. The way that universities deliver their teaching and other services will change over the coming weeks, in light of new advice, and to recognise that students may wish to work from home, in the UK or overseas. Universities will not close as they have commitments to students, including those who live on campus. Many research facilities must run around the clock and student support and IT infrastructure systems require continuous attention. Now that the UK has moved into the \\u2018delay\\u2019 phase of the outbreak, many universities will start to transition to online learning and assessment for students in subjects where this is possible. They will offer revised guidance for staff who may need to work remotely. The precise pace of this transition will vary by institution, reflecting different term dates and other factors. As large institutions, which educate and employ many thousands of people, it is sensible that we are responsive to this outbreak, in a manner that is consistent with public health advice. Health secretary Matt Hancock urged people in the UK to be responsible when stocking up on supplies and that the government could take measures to ensure they do so. Meanwhile, in north London, shoppers queue en masse to enter the local Waitrose. French president Emmanuel Macron has said the government had no option but to impose stricter measures to tackle the coronavirus, but that the country would get through the crisis if it acted responsibly. \\u201cI am the guarantor of the health of our citizens and also the democratic life of our country,\\u201d he said, defending his decision to hold local elections \\u2013 which have been postponed in the UK. \\u201cWe will overcome this crisis by being responsible together and for each other,\\u201d he said, after casting his vote in northern France. Macron said the decision to close shops and restaurants needed to be made because too many people were being too lax in how they protected themselves from the virus. Meanwhile, a reader in the Rh\\u00f4ne valley, in the south of France, has been in touch to say voters have been asked to bring their own pens to the polling stations. The Scottish government is not planning to ask over-70\\u2019s to self-isolate, contrary to the UK government. Instead, elderly people in Scotland will be asked to reduce social contact. Jeane Freeman, Scottish health secretary confirmed the plans after UK health secretary Hancock said potential future measures to force over-70s to stay at home were a \\u201cvery big ask\\u201d, but said it would be for their own \\u201cself-protection\\u201d. Asked about whether Scotland would follow suit, Freeman said: The additional measures that we\\u2019ve always talked about are about reducing contact for those over 70 and in their eighties, asking them to reduce their social contact because they are one of the groups who are most at risk of this virus making them seriously ill. The other group is people who have underlying health conditions whose immune system is suppressed. It\\u2019s not isolation, it\\u2019s asking them to reduce social contact. We don\\u2019t want people who are elderly to be stuck in their homes alone not contacting anyone, with their families not able to be in touch with them and to help them. What were saying to them is, reduce your contact. The news of the potential isolation of elderly people was briefed anonymously to journalists overnight and has led to criticism over how the UK government is communicating policies and advice. Overnight anonymous briefings to Sunday journalists are common, but there have been calls for a new approach in light of the pandemic. Asked about how the news emerged, Freeman said: It\\u2019s not how we would do it. Government\\u2019s should be coming and explaining these things really clearly. Overnight briefing, background briefing, unattributed sources is not the way to ensure that the public are understanding what we are trying to do and our working with us to do that. Urgent efforts to repatriate 30,000 British tourists from ski resorts in France are under way amid warnings of \\u201cwidespread failures\\u201d in the travel sector in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. French mountains resorts closed at midnight on Saturday just hours after tens of thousands had landed for their annual holiday in the snow. Leading ski and summer activity holiday company Neilson has called for the government to step in with \\u201cemergency measures\\u201d. There were reports of chaos and confusion across the Alps with one source saying local police had taken the French government\\u2019s message into their own hands and going round hotels and restaurants telling marooned Britons to go home immediately. Diane Palumbo, sales and marketing director at SkiWorld, said she had 900 customers across the Alps and they had been in talks with all the key resorts on Friday to warn them that if they were to close not to do so on Saturday when a fresh influx of tourists were scheduled to arrive. \\u201cWe are getting over our anger. It was literally not until 10pm last night that we were confident of the information we were receiving. The same people who had assured us on Thursday, Friday or even Saturday that they would remain open, have now all closed,\\u201d she said. The French prime minister, \\u00c9douard Philippe, announced that the country must \\u201cclose all non-essential locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops\\u201d from midnight. Although ski-resorts were not specifically listed, the ski industry in the UK believe they are all closing. One of the biggest operators, Inghams, said \\u201cas a responsible tour operator\\u201d it would not be operating any more holidays to French resorts for the rest of the season and advised those who were due to go out on Sunday to abandon plans. Palumbo said all those who had booked through an ATOL backed agent would get their money back but that small- to medium-sized tour operators and travel companies could go bust. \\u201cThe airlines are very quick to ask for help from the government but this is a massive flow of people which will costs the industry millions. If the government does not step in travel companies will start to fail because the cost of repatriation will be enormous,\\u201d she said. David Taylor, chief executive of Neilson holidays, said it was \\u201chugely disappointed\\u201d that it received such short notice on the closures. He called for emergency measures for the sector. With the Covid-19 crisis likely to last several months, we are asking the government to consider emergency measures specifically targeted at the travel and leisure sector to deliver immediate relief and help avoid widespread failures. This remains an isolated issue on 2020 departures only and we are confident that next year will see a healthy recovery provided a swathe of relief measures recommended to the government are enacted. Separately Ryanair was frantically working to repatriate customers stranded in Spain after the country was thrown into lockdown arrangements. It has also cancelled all flights to and from Poland. \\u201cRyanair Group Airlines (including Buzz and Lauda) has been forced to severely reduce flights to/from Spain, the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands from 24.00 Sun 15 Mar until 24.00 Thurs 19 Mar,\\u201d it said in a statement. It added it was \\u201ccontacting all affected customers by email to advise them of their options and we urge customs not to call us\\u201d. Earlier, it announced all flights \\u201cto and from Poland have been cancelled from midnight on Saturday to midnight on 31 March\\u201d. The Foreign Office has advised against \\u201call but essential travel\\u201d to the US after president Trump introduced a travel ban on the UK over the coronavirus pandemic. A Foreign Office spokesman said: We are advising against all but essential travel to the USA following the US government announcement imposing restrictions on travel from the UK (and Ireland) effective from midnight on Monday March 16 EST (4am GMT on Tuesday March 17). British nationals with journeys planned and citizens already in the US are advised to contact their airlines or tour operators. Health minister Nadine Dorries has reassured people panic-buying toilet roll that she has not run out of the bathroom essential during her week in self-isolation. However, it was unclear how many rolls she had in her house when her period of quarantine began after she tested positive earlier this week. A piece authored by the novelist has been published n the Times (paywall) this morning, documenting the Tory MP\\u2019s coronavirus ordeal. I will always remember how I felt the moment I was told that I had tested positive for the coronavirus \\u2014 not least because it was the very last thing I was expecting to hear. A diagnosis would make no difference to how I behaved or dealt with my symptoms. But I had my 84-year-old mother staying with me for a few weeks and, despite the fact that she has survived polio, rheumatic fever, major heart surgery and a world war, she is not in the best of health. The community nursing team were waiting for me as I drove into a Covid-19 testing centre on a local industrial estate. It resembled the tyre-change bay at my local garage. Unlike with my situation, we know exactly where [her mother] caught it from and the irony is, despite her having had major surgery to replace the valves in her heart damaged by childhood illness, despite her pacemaker and breathlessness, her lifetime of smoking, hard work in her early years and poor diet, she had much milder symptoms than me. G7 leaders will discuss the importance of a coordinated response to the impact of coronavirus on the global economy, according to No 10 following a phone conversation between Boris Johnson and Japanese prime minister Shinz\\u014d Abe. A Downing Street spokesperson said: The prime minister spoke to Japanese prime minister Abe about the coronavirus pandemic. The leaders updated each other on their countries\\u2019 efforts to curb the spread of the virus. The prime minister stressed the importance the UK is placing on taking a science-led approach when deciding what measures to implement. The prime minister and prime minister Abe agreed on the importance of international coordination to tackle the virus and its wider impact, particularly on the global economy, and they looked forward to the call between G7 leaders to discuss this. The prime minster and prime minister Abe also discussed the UK and Japan\\u2019s efforts to combat climate change ahead of COP26 in Glasgow later this year. Following reports of passengers not being able to claim refunds on flights to Spain after the British government advised against all but essential travel to the whole country, Ryanair has told customers they will be informed of their options. Muslim authorities have announced that part of the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, is to close indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the esplanade outside. Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government. Ministers are planning to give police in the UK the power to arrest people with coronavirus who are not self-isolating, the health secretary has confirmed. \\u201cWe are going to take the powers to make sure that we can quarantine people if they are a risk to public health, yes, and that\\u2019s important,\\u201d Matt Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show on the BBC. \\u201cI doubt that actually we will need to use it much because people have been very responsible.\\u201d The emergency powers will be set out on Tuesday before the legislation is outlined in a Bill due to be published on Thursday, Hancock said. Meanwhile, the government has been urged to prioritise the testing of doctors for coronavirus to ensure adequate staff levels during the pandemic. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the council of the British Medical Association, said he \\u201ccan\\u2019t emphasise enough how serious the problem is\\u201d if numerous healthcare workers are self-isolating, and he urged the government to ensure that GP practices can run \\u201cin a normal fashion\\u201d. Scottish Labour has urged the government to close the country\\u2019s parliament to the public. The demand comes as a \\u00a3320m support package was unveiled for the next financial year. Scottish Labour business manager Elaine Smith said: As we were advised at last week\\u2019s bureau, there are now increasing pressures on the cleaning contract and the staff that the private contractor employees. If we close to the public and also close the public gallery, caf\\u00e9, shop, toilets etc, then efforts could be employed to concentrate on cleaning elsewhere in the building. I presume the aim is to try and keep the members meeting for as long as possible and, as such, restricting the visitors to the building would also help to substantially cut the risk to elected members. Closing the building to the public would also mean the possibility of a reduced police presence and less pressure on our security staff. Union leaders are calling for private hospital beds in the UK to be used rent free, to ease pressure on NHS hospitals dealing with the coronavirus crisis. The GMB union has launched a petition urging the prime minister to requisition private hospital beds, amid reports the NHS is to spend up to \\u00a32.4m a day to do so. Rehana Azam, GMB national officer, said: It\\u2019s time to take back these beds for the NHS, rent free. This is a public health emergency. Not a business opportunity for shoddy private healthcare chums to profiteer from distress. Not a penny of taxpayer cash should line pockets of grotesquely wealthy health firms. Private resources must be requisitioned for public good. France will start reducing plane, train and coach services between cities from Sunday to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, two ministers said on Sunday. In a joint news conference, ecology minister Elisabeth Borne and transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said cargo services would continue as normal, as would city metro services. \\u201cWe have to limit our movements as much as possible. Long distance trips must be kept to what is strictly necessary,\\u201d Borne said. Djebbari said the number of long-distance trains would be cut by half, while several airport terminals in Paris would be closed. Meanwhile, social distancing measures were observed in Paris as people stood a metre apart from each other while queueing at a bakery which is only letting three people in at a time this morning. Iran\\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus has reached 724, with 113 new deaths in the past 24 hours, an official confirmed, adding that some 13,938 people have been infected across the country. \\u201cIn the past 24 hours, 1,209 new cases have been confirmed ... with 113 deaths in the past 24 hours, the death toll has reached 724,\\u201d tweeted Alireza Vahabzadeh, an adviser to Iran\\u2019s health minister. Meanwhile, Iran\\u2019s official leading the response to the coronavirus outbreak acknowledged that it could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe US sanctions. Colombia is to expel four Europeans for violating compulsory quarantine protocols designed to halt the spread of the coronavirus, just hours after it closed its border with Venezuela, the government said on Saturday. Two men and two women of French and Spanish nationality will be deported after ignoring mandatory instructions to isolate themselves and leaving their hotels, against the warnings of staff, the migration agency said. Colombia has so far reported 22 cases of the virus and has declared a health emergency to contain the disease. Measures include suspending public gatherings of more than 500 people and blocking cruise ships from entering its ports, Reuters reported. President Ivan Duque said Colombia would close its border with Venezuela starting Saturday, while arrivals who are not residents or nationals and have stayed in Europe or Asia during the last two weeks will not be allowed to enter from Monday. Matt Hancock, the UK health secretary, said Britain has not ruled out following other countries and closing restaurants, bars and other shops to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. When asked if ministers were planning on shutting up shops other than pharmacies and supermarkets, Hancock told the BBC\\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t ruled that out, we will do what is necessary.\\u201d Government contingency plans briefed a fortnight ago that retired doctors, and leavers of the profession, would be called on to return to work in the event of a major pandemic were met with scepticism. Scores of retired NHS doctors and nurses told the Guardian they are against returning to work to help tackle coronavirus, with many saying it would threaten their physical and mental health. Asked whether he is confident in the government\\u2019s approach of calling on retired doctors to help, BMA chair Dr Nagpaul said: I think that we need information now, I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019ve got that information. As I said earlier, you can\\u2019t just get doctors to return back to work instantly \\u2013 we need to understand how they\\u2019ll be registered, how they\\u2019ll be trained, exactly what they\\u2019ll be doing \\u2013 especially for many retired doctors who could also be in a risk group. They can provide care but in a remote fashion, not patient-facing. We really need those answers, plans, now. Freedom of movement will be \\u201cmassively limited\\u201d in Austria as part of drastic measures to fight the spread of Covid-19. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced the measures would include closing playgrounds and sports grounds across the alpine country from Tuesday. Non-essential shops, restaurants and bars will also close. Travel restrictions will be further tightened, with border checks imposed between Austria and Switzerland, people no longer allowed to enter the country from Great Britain, the Netherlands, Ukraine and Russia. Kurz said the coming weeks would be \\u201cchallenging, difficult and painful\\u201d, but assured the public that the supply of crucial goods would be uninterrupted. Shops including pharmacies and drugstores are to remain open for now. Austria has had 800 confirmed cases of coronavirus so far, with the Tyrol region emerging as one of the hotspots of the infection. One person has died as a result of the virus. Ireland\\u2019s taoiseach has warned he may seek enforcement powers to stop large gatherings in pubs after drunken scenes in Dublin\\u2019s city centre last night caused alarm with cabinet colleagues. The Irish government is concerned that members of the public are not taking the coronavirus emergency measures which involves closures of schools and bans of indoor gatherings of more than 100 seriously enough. Varadkar added: People who have been out this weekend should avoid physical contact with seniors or people with chronic diseases. You could make them very very sick. His warning comes 12 hours after European affairs minister Helen McEntee expressed alarm following posts on social media of drunken sing-alongs in pubs. She pleaded with the public to be vigilant and pay heed to social distancing advice which warns that to do otherwise could force closures across the hospitality sector with devastating consequences for business owners, their staff and families. Health minister Simon Harris had described drunken scenes in Dublin\\u2019s Temple Bar, an area popular with tourists and stag and hen parties, as \\u201can insult\\u201d to the efforts of health workers fighting to stem the disease in hospitals nearby. Ireland announced its emergency measures on Thursday and followed up with a summit with the Northern Ireland executive yesterday after which Arlene Foster revealed schools in the region could be closed for \\u201cat least 16 weeks\\u201d. Jordan has announced six new cases of the novel coronavirus, the day after implementing a raft of quarantine measures including the banning of all passenger flights in and out of the country from Tuesday. The kingdom\\u2019s health minister said the cases included four French tourists, a Jordanian citizen who had come from the UK and another Jordanian who had been in contact with a US tourist who visited Jordan. Another case, a 70-year-old man, was tested positive in Tel Aviv and had spent time in Jordan. A Canadian tourist also tested positive there shortly after she had left the kingdom, where the all-important tourism season has just started. The four French people are said to have stayed at a Dead Sea hotel. I\\u2019ve been ringing around to find out where exactly, but a staffer at one told me they had yet to be told anything and were \\u201cvery worried\\u201d. Before these new infections, the sole confirmed case was a man who had contracted the disease but recovered. Jordan has shut schools, universities, mosques, churches and tourist sites to try to contain the virus. Greece has closed all its archaeological sites including the 5th century BCE Acropolis. With few other places to go, Athenians this weekend gathered on rocks beneath the ancient monument. The chairman of the British Medical Association, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, has suggested that sustained cuts left the UK\\u2019s public healthcare system far more unprepared than other European countries at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. He said the UK\\u2019s relative lack of ventilators was \\u201ca result of a decade of under-funding\\u201d and urged the government to provide \\u201cclear, decisive plans\\u201d to ensure that healthcare workers can provide the care patients need. Our starting position unfortunately has been far worse than many other of our European nations \\u2013 we have about a quarter of the critical care beds that Germany has, as an example, so it\\u2019s really critical, it\\u2019s really important that we now see transparently what plans the government has to expand that capacity.\\u201d Asked whether the whole GP system needs to be looked at, Nagpaul added: We need to have clear plans how patients can be remotely managed and how the technology can support that. Yes. And one of the most immediate priorities of course is we don\\u2019t have enough doctors. Before the outbreak we were 10,000 doctors short, so we\\u2019re very worried and the doctors I represent are very concerned that they don\\u2019t, for example, have adequate protection. Meanwhile, the Labour leadership contender Lisa Nandy accused the government\\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak of being a \\u201cshambles\\u201d. She criticised ministers for \\u201cgoing to ground\\u201d after an apparent U-turn on banning mass gatherings and reports that powers may be handed to police and immigration officers to arrest sick people who will not self-isolate. She told the BBC\\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: I think even he [Matt Hancock] will accept that the last 48 hours has been a real shambles. This is causing serious concern out in the public. People just don\\u2019t know what to do for the best. There is no reason to panic but we need far more information from the Government. This is a public health crisis and so the public must have confidence in the strategy the government is following. More than 150 \\u201cmutual aid\\u201d groups have been formed across the UK to provide support from shopping, dog walking and picking up prescriptions within communities. The groups, which number at least 174 and are being coordinated nationally by \\u2018Covid-19 Mutual Aid UK\\u2019, have organised online meetings today and are handing out flyers in streets. As well as practical support the groups are offering telephone calls with people who are self-isolating due to infection or increased vulnerability. Anna Vickerstaff, one of the coordinators of the national network, said: Groups are being set up and run entirely by volunteers - and our hope is that they can help to make sure people who need support get it. With the NHS and public services having been so ruthlessly underfunded in the last decade, we really just want to make sure that people don\\u2019t end up suffering alone, or without the basics and support that they need from the outside world. There\\u2019s some pretty big questions about whether or not the government\\u2019s response to this crisis has been fit for purpose. So it\\u2019s even more important that so many ordinary people across the country are keen to offer solidarity to each other in a moment of need. Releasing low-risk prisoners is not yet part of government plans to limit the spread of the coronavirus in \\u201cgrossly overcrowded\\u201d prisons, according to the Prison Officers Association. When asked by Sky News\\u2019s Sophy Ridge if releasing some prisoners was in the contingency plan, Steve Gillan, general secretary of the association, said: Not as yet but previous governments have done what was called an executive release of prisoners, that may come in the future to free up spaces in prisons. He explained this could be in the form of temporary release or a decision by the secretary of state to release low-risk category prisoners towards the end of their sentences. He added there were problems caused by a limited amount of single-capacity cells in the prison system. No one to my knowledge as of this morning has actually been tested positive but they have been isolated in single-cell accommodation. We all know prisons are grossly overcrowded and that can only happen for a period of time. People in Norway have been ordered to leave their countryside cabins and return to their homes, due to fears rural hospitals could be ovewhelmed, according to Norwegian media. The municipalities that have many cottages should be able to take care of their own inhabitants in a very demanding situation, health minister Bent H\\u00f8ie reportedly said. This means that everyone now has to follow the strong request of the prime minister to pack their cases and go home. If they do not, we will prohibit them from staying in the cabin. It comes after prime minister Erna Solberg threatened to deploy the civil defence to bring people home from their cabins. An 83-year-old British national has tested positive for coronavirus after disembarking a cruise ship in Chile, local media reported. The man, who was travelling on the Silver Explorer, is in a \\u201cgood condition\\u201d in hospital in Coyhaique, Patagonia, the country\\u2019s health minister Jaime Manalich said, as quoted in La Tercera. Chile has quarantined nearly 1,300 passengers on board the Silver Explorer and another ship in the port of Chacabuco. Following the man\\u2019s diagnosis, the 500 residents of Caleta Tortel have also been made subject of restrictions for a fortnight after the passenger was in contact with several members of the community, the Chilean health ministry said. Here is some from Matt Hancock\\u2019s announcement earlier. He said requesting all over 70-year-olds to self-isolate is a \\u201cvery big ask\\u201d, but is a measure which is for their own \\u201cself-protection\\u201d. In the coming weeks, over-70\\u2019s will be asked to self-isolate for up to four months, in order to protect them from the virus, he told Sky\\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. That is in the action plan, yes, and we will be setting it out with more detail when it is the right time to do so, because we absolutely appreciate that it is a very big ask of the elderly and the vulnerable, and it\\u2019s for their own self-protection \\u2026 Certainly in the coming weeks, absolutely. Our generation has never been tested like this. Our grandparents were, during the second world war, when our cities were bombed during the Blitz. Despite the pounding every night, the rationing, the loss of life, they pulled together in one gigantic national effort. Today our generation is facing its own test, fighting a very real and new disease.\\u201d Experts on the UK\\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies have set out the need for extra action to slow the spread of the disease. The panel advised that the next interventions \\u201cwill need to be instituted soon\\u201d. Those measures will include steps to shield the vulnerable from the virus, including the elderly and those with existing health problems, by telling them to stay in their houses or care homes. There could also be a shift to household isolation rather than individual self-isolation. Meanwhile, a new-born baby in England who has tested positive for coronavirus is likely to be one of the world\\u2019s youngest patients with the disease. The infant and its mother both tested positive at a north London hospital and staff who had contact with them have been advised to self-isolate. The developments come as the UK\\u2019s approach to developing \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d against Covid-19 has been called into question. But Hancock denied that achieving herd immunity was part of the government\\u2019s policy. Responding to criticism from parts of the scientific community, and when asked by Ridge if he was playing \\u201croulette\\u201d with public safety, Hancock replied: \\u201cNo, obviously.\\u201d What we will do is listen to all the credible scientists and we will look at all the evidence. Herd immunity is not our goal or policy, it\\u2019s a scientific concept. Our policy is to protect lives and to beat this virus. Heartwarming scenes in Madrid as people applaud healthcare workers from their balconies last night. The UK is unlikely to have a vaccine for this round of the coronavirus pandemic, according to former chief scientific adviser Mark Walport He told Sky\\u2019s Sophy Ridge: Vaccines are being developed at a very fast rate so there are a number of candidates: large companies, small companies, universities all working. The challenge here is to make sure the vaccine is safe and it works, and unfortunately, that takes a period of time to do so realistically. It\\u2019s very unlikely that we are going to have a vaccine for the present round of this epidemic. We are talking months, up to a year. Walport added it was \\u201cquite likely\\u201d that a large percentage of the population would get coronavirus, but many would be mild or sub-clinical. Meanwhile, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called on Boris Johnson to hold another press conference today if the coronavirus situation has changed. Speaking on the same programme earlier, he said: The World Health Organization is saying that we should continue testing and contact tracing. They\\u2019re saying that is the best way to break the chain of contagion. The UK have taken a different view that if you feel ill that you just stay at home for seven days and won\\u2019t be tested. Many people are saying to me that they need a Covid-19 test if they\\u2019re ill because they need to know whether they should be interacting with other people in a few weeks\\u2019 time. So I just need to understand better why the government is taking a different approach, based on its science, from other countries and I think that\\u2019s why it is so important that all the scientific modelling for example is published. If things have changed since Thursday, and things are changing quickly, if things have changed since the prime minister\\u2019s press conference on Thursday then the prime minister should be doing another press conference today and explaining why things have changed. German newspaper Welt am Sonntag has reported that US president Donald Trump has sought exclusive rights to a vaccine for the coronavirus which is being developed by a German-based company, CureVac. The report, which quoted unnamed sources, said Trump had offered large sums of money to German scientists working on the vaccine, and that the Germany government was working to prevent the US procuring it on this basis. Australian health authorities have confirmed two more deaths from coronavirus in the past three days. A 77-year-old Queensland woman died in New South Wales on Friday. NSW Health said the woman had recently arrived in Sydney. According to AAP, she developed symptoms on the plane, was taken to hospital and died the same day. NSW Health also said a 90-year-old woman - a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge \\u2013 died on Saturday. Testing has confirmed that she had COVID-19. Four people diagnosed with coronavirus have now died in NSW while an elderly man who spent time on the Diamond Princess cruise ship died in Perth, Western Australia, earlier in March. Greek authorities have confirmed a fourth death from coronavirus, saying a 53-year-old man succumbed to Covid-19 early on Sunday. The man, the youngest victim so far, was reported to have contracted the virus working in a hospital in the northern city of Kastoria. Famous for its fur trade \\u2013 and links with Italy - the town has been hard hit by coronavirus. Locals who attended Milan\\u2019s fashion week in February are among those who have fallen ill. News of the fatality follows a health ministry announcement that 228 people have so far contracted the virus in Greece \\u2013 the vast majority are Greek and do not of course include the like of Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson who were recently made honorary citizens of the country. Of that number five are said to be in critical condition in specialist hospital units around the country. As of today, Greeks will be banned from public beaches and ski resorts after prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis took the unprecedented step of ordering both closed in a further bid to curb the spread of the novel virus. The leader was prompted to make the move after scenes emerged of Greeks converging on shorelines as temperatures climbed to 22C on Saturday. \\u201cI just gave the order for all organised beaches and ski resorts to close tomorrow. The situation is serious and requires responsibility from all. We should avoid public places with lots of people. Let us all rise to the occasion.\\u201d Hancock is confident the food supply will continue, though he again refused to provide a guarantee. I understand why people are stocking up but they have to behave responsibly ... and consider the impact their stocking up may have on others. And we stand ready to take further measures if that\\u2019s necessary. Questioned about the UK\\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been described as idiosyncratic, he said the country will take the right decisions at the right time based on the scientific advice. He said the government would publish its coronavirus modelling, from which the scientific advice is based, within the next couple of days. \\u201cOur advice is one of the most transparent in the world,\\u201d he declared. \\u201cThe best science is done in the open so people can challenge ... and make suggestions.\\u201d The UK has been through worse as a country but the coronavirus pandemic is a very significant challenge, health secretary Matt Hancock has told Sky. It will disrupt the lives of almost everyone in the country, he conceded. He called for a \\u201cnational effort\\u201d from hand-washing to ventilator production to help prevent the disease spreading and to save lives. Every single person can act by washing their hands to prevent the disease spreading. Washing your hands is the single most important thing you can do. It slows the spread and kills the virus. We are working to buy as many ventilators as possible. We start with around 5,000 and we need many times more than that. He said government was working with the private sector to buy the ventilators that are available and to encourage manufacturing companies to switch production to the machines. The demand for them is incredibly high. It is not possible to produce too many of them. Anybody who can should turn their production and engineering minds to the production of ventilators. However, he could not confirm everyone who requires one will have access, and he confirmed that the government is set to ask, at some point in the coming weeks, over-70s to self-isolate for months at some point in the UK.

I\\u2019m leaving the blog in the hands of my colleague Mattha Busby. In Australia, the ABC is reporting that a woman from Noosaville infected with coronavirus died on Friday. We will have more on this shortly. Meanwhile AAP reports that around 80 people have been asked to self-isolate after a University of Sydney student was diagnosed with coronavirus over the weekend. As Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders prepare for the next democratic debate, in considerably different circumstances from those just under three weeks ago, the virus continues to spread in the US \\u2013 though Trump remains coronavirus free. More universities saw students affected by Covid-19, Metro Manilla\\u2019s 12 million people prepared to be sealed off, and Australia announced mandatory self-quarantine for all travellers arriving from overseas. US President Donald Trump tested negative for coronavirus. A White House physician has issued a statement confirming that Trump does not have Covid-19. It came after the US president confirmed he had been tested for the virus at a press briefing earlier on Saturday. The international travel industry faced a widespread shutdown over coronavirus fears after airlines announced new flight reductions and more countries introduced travel bans and isolation requirements. Chaos reigned at US airports. Social media users posted pictures from Chicago O\\u2019Hare International Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas showing general chaos and tightly packed crowds. The Israeli justice ministry postponed the Netanyahu trial to May. The ministry announced a scheduled court hearing on Tuesday, the first day of a blockbuster corruption trial against Benjamin Netanyahu, will not happen until at least May due to the coronavirus. The Australian government have ordered that all overseas travellers self-isolate for fourteen days upon their return. The legally enforceable requirement includes Australian citizens. The Australian cruise ship industry was thrown into turmoil after a government ban on docking in Australia was announced after a widespread voluntary suspension of all major cruises. Yale University in the US and the Universities of Sydney and the University of New South Wales in Australia each confirmed their first cases. Yale asked that students not return from until the end of the spring semester in May. Presidential presidential primaries in the US state of Georgia were postponed. They were set to take place on 24 March. US clothing brand Everlane joined Apple, Urban Outfitters and Verizon in closing stores over coronavirus concerns. Mexico has registered a rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 41, from 26 a day earlier, the Mexican health ministry said on Saturday. The country has not confirmed any deaths from the fast-spreading virus. South Korea\\u2019s downward trend continued. South Korea reported 76 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the country\\u2019s total to 8,162 with 75 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. In the Philippines, police started sealing off metropolitan Manila, home to more than 12 million people, AP reports. No new cases have been confirmed among the cast and crew of the film actors Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson were working on. The couple announced they had tested positive earlier this week while in Australia. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will announce a multi-billion dollar economic stimulus on Tuesday as the country awakens to the shock measures needed to fight Covid-19. COVID-19 infections have jumped to 110 confirmed cases in Egypt according to the country\\u2019s Ministry of Health, up from 80 on Friday. Egyptian president Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi declared on Saturday that \\u00a35.2bn would be drawn from budgetary reserves as part of a plan to combat \\u201cany consequences of the virus.\\u201d Yet as the Egyptian government slowly grapples with rising infection rates, the challenges of social distancing in a densely-populated country of 100 million people are becoming increasingly clear. Egypt\\u2019s authorities announced over the weekend that all nurseries, schools and universities will be closed from today and sports events suspended, on top of a ban on mass gatherings. Prayer times have been limited to fifteen minutes, and face masks distributed for travellers on the Cairo metro during busy times as part of what Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly declared as the \\u201csecond phase,\\u201d of Egypt\\u2019s response to COVID-19. This is due to the \\u201cdiscovery of more infection clusters,\\u201d since 45 passengers and crew on board a cruise ship in Luxor tested positive for the virus on Friday 6th March. Tom Hanks has thanked his \\u201chelpers\\u201d on Twitter. The actor and his wife Rita Wilson tested positive for coronavirus earlier this week while in Australia. In Australia, here is everything we know about the new measures announced today by the prime minister, Scott Morrison. The Guardian\\u2019s Paul Karp and Lisa Cox report that people in some states could face hefty fines if they do not comply with new government restrictions aimed at containing the spread of coronavirus, with the prime minister announcing strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days. Meanwhile Australia\\u2019s schools will remain open nationally despite escalating government restrictions on other aspects of life such as travel due to the spread of the coronavirus, however but new social distancing measures have been announced for schools in New South Wales. The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure. \\u201cSchools have been a focus of the community and the government as the impacts of the coronavirus have developed globally,\\u201d Scott said. \\u201cFrom Monday onwards I expect assemblies and substantial gatherings to be cancelled, along with all excursions.\\u201d All interschool arts and sports events have also been cancelled. In Australia, the University of New South Wales has now confirmed that one if its students has tested positive for coronavirus. The announcement follows the confirmation of a case at the University of Sydney shortly beforehand. The below email screenshot was shared with the Guardian: Israel\\u2019s justice ministry just announced a scheduled court hearing on Tuesday, the first day of a blockbuster corruption trial against Benjamin Netanyahu, will not happen until at least May due to the coronavirus. The prime minister faces three separate inquiries, including charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies the charges but the trial had appeared to be a serious threat to his continued rule while he is already politically weakened. The 70-year-old leader has failed to form a government following three inconclusive elections during the past 12 months. Israel is battling the coronavirus outbreak while also in a stale of political deadlock, with Netanyahu demanding rival politicians help him form an emergency government immediately. The country\\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, will meet with political parties later on Sunday to see if a majority coalition can be formed, although a breakthrough after months of stalemate could be unlikely. There are now 156,400 coronavirus cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins. There have been 5,833 deaths related to the virus. Here are 10 countries with the highest numbers of confirmed cases: China: 80,995 Italy: 21,157 Iran: 12,729 South Korea: 8,086 Spain: 6,391 Germany: 4,585 France: 4,481 US: 2,952 Switzerland: 1,359 United Kingdom: 1,143 Here is more information on Australia\\u2019s new self-isolation requirements: The $5.2bn Australian cruise ship industry has been thrown into chaos after a government ban on docking in Australia was announced after a widespread voluntary suspension of all major cruises. As most major lines suspended all cruises for 30 days due to travel restrictions from the coronavirus passengers were asked to disembark from cruises on Sunday while other trips were cancelled at the last minute. Most companies were offering passengers refunds and three days accommodation in a hotel. Ships which had already sailed for Australia were sent back to port. Royal Caribbean Cruises was among the lines to announce global voluntary suspension in the past few days until mid-April. The University of Sydney has confirmed that one of its students has coronavirus. \\u201cSix locations on the University of Sydney campus are being intensively cleaned today (Sunday 15 March) after a student was diagnosed with Covid-19 on the weekend,\\u201d the university said in a statement on its website. The case is one of the 22 new cases announced by New South Wales authorities earlier today. We are hearing rumours of a case at the University of New South Wales but this is currently unconfirmed. The US is on course to be severely ravaged by the coronavirus outbreak due to a delayed and dysfunctional testing regime and misleading messaging from the Trump administration, public health experts have warned. As of Friday, there were more than 1,600 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus across the US, with 41 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. However, the actual number of infected Americans is certain to be far higher, with the true toll obscured by a calamitous lack of testing. A lack of planning and restrictions that barred testing people without symptoms, even though the virus can be asymptomatic for some time, or those not arriving from overseas virus hotspots has needlessly worsened the situation, critics said. In other developments around Latin America on Saturday, Colombia expelled two French nationals and two Spaniards for violating coronavirus quarantine rules. The two couples separately took tourist trips in defiance of restrictions imposed on visitors from the worst-affected countries, immigration officials said. Ecuador announced it was closing its borders to foreigners after the country registered its second coronavirus death. In Bolivia, a ban on direct flights to and from Europe went into effect on Saturday. Travelers from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain are also banned from entry. Panama banned flights from Asia, one day after blocking flights from Europe. Authorities also announced that schools will shutter in Venezuela, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Uruguay. As of 2200 GMT Saturday, Latin America had registered 6 coronavirus deaths and 430 cases of infection. Chile has quarantined more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced Saturday. Both ships are cruising the Chilean fjords in Patagonia. The 85-year-old man showed symptoms of the virus after getting off the Silver Explorer ship in the far southern port of Caleta Tortel, 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) from Santiago. The man was later transferred to a hospital in the city of Coyhaique where he tested positive for the virus. Chile has taken broad measures against the spread of the virus, banning events of more than 500 people, recommending people work from home, and ordering the quarantine of 2,600 students attending an elite private school in Santiago. Thailand reported 32 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the total infections in the Southeast Asian country to 114, health officials said. It was the biggest daily jump in cases in Thailand, which was one of the first countries outside China to report coronavirus infections that has since swept much of the world. Myanmar\\u2019s government has rejected suggestions that the country has undetected cases of the virus, reiterating that it is free of any infections and that \\u201cthe lifestyle and diet of Myanmar citizens\\u201d has helped protect the country. According to Global New Light of Myanmar, a state-run news source, the director general of the ministry of office of the state counsellor, U Zaw Htay, told a press conference: Myanmar does not share the customs of greeting with handshakes, hugs or kisses that [Western] countries have. It also does not have a high number of credit card users compared to other nations, as the person handling credit cards at the counter would be in close contact with hundred of different people in a day. This is avoided by Myanmar\\u2019s predominant use of paper currency. U Zaw Htay added that the government was taking measures to prepare for the pandemic, and that people should avoid large gatherings, maintain good personal hygiene and not panic buy at shops. Severe legal action would be taken against anyone sharing fake news online and against any businesses attempting to make profit from the situation, reporters were told. Myanmar recently cancelled water festivals due to take place next month to mark the Buddhist New Year. Other Southeast Asian countries are also scaling back planned events. South Africa\\u2019s mining and tourism industries are bracing for a virus buffeting, AFP reports. Around 18.5% of South African exports go to China, with mining commodities making up around 86% of total trade with the Asian country. With China\\u2019s growth expected to slow as a result of Covid-19, the demand for minerals is also expected to take a knock potentially affecting commodity prices and costing the industry millions. South Africa\\u2019s economy is already fragile. It slipped into recession in the final three months of 2019, the second contraction to hit the economy in as many years. That contraction was largely blamed on erratic electricity supplies. The virus \\u201cwill turn out to be a national crisis\\u201d and \\u201cit will have a huge impact... on our economy which as we all know is in a very precarious situation,\\u201d President Cyril Ramaphosa said when the first case was detected last week. China ranked the seventh largest origin of foreign visitors to South Africa in 2018. South Africa has so far imposed no travel bans on Chinese visitors, but Beijing has blocked outbound group travel from China. \\u201cDespite the fact that we have had very few cases of the virus, the local tourism industry has already suffered serious losses,\\u201d lamented Tourism Minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane, said earlier last week. The country has 38 confirmed cases. The South African fisheries industry was one of the first casualties after China halted animal imports. China traditionally imports 95% of South African rock lobsters harvests. Queensland, Australia state premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has shed some light on how the federal government\\u2019s self-quarantine requirement will be enforced, as the state sees its biggest one-day jump since the start of the outbreak, with 15 new cases. Palaszczuk said there were heavy fines for anyone who did not follow the directive to self-isolate under the \\u2018Public Health Emergency Act\\u2019. \\u201cThat bill was passed in early February and there are penalties for not complying with the notification and that is around $13,000,\\u201d she told AAP. \\u201cWe have random police checks to make sure people are compliant with that notice.\\u201d The announcement from Israel that it will use anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise coronavirus transmission follows a series of ever-stricter restrictions imposed by the Israeli government to contain the virus, Reuters reports. The Israeli military said earlier on Saturday that it had ordered all troops to be back on their bases by Sunday morning, and that combat soldiers should prepare for a lengthy stay with no leave for up to a month. Last week anyone entering Israel was ordered to self-isolate for two weeks and schools have been shut. Tens of thousands of Israelis are presently quarantined. Israel\\u2019s Health Ministry said 193 people have tested positive, with no fatalities. Many had been on international flights in the past two weeks. More now on Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu\\u2019s plans to use anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Cyber tech monitoring would be deployed to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus, subject to cabinet approval, Netanyahu told a news conference in Jerusalem. \\u201cWe will very soon begin using technology ... digital means that we have been using in order to fight terrorism,\\u201d Netanyahu said. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\\u2019 privacy. The Shin Bet, Israel\\u2019s domestic security service, confirmed that it was examining the use of its technological capabilities to fight coronavirus, at the request of Netanyahu and the Health Ministry, Reuters reports. Avner Pinchuk, a privacy expert with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said such capabilities could include real-time tracking of infected persons\\u2019 mobile phones to spot quarantine breaches and backtracking through meta-data to figure out where they had been and who they had contacted. \\u201cI am troubled by this announcement. I understand that we are in unique circumstances, but this seems potentially like over-reach. Much will depend on how intrusive the new measures are,\\u201d said Pinchuk. The Shin Bet, however, said in its statement that quarantine enforcement was not on the table. \\u201cThere is no intention of using said technologies for enforcement or tracking in the context of isolation guidelines,\\u201d it said. The US city of Hoboken, across the Hudson River from New York City, has announced a night curfew starting 16 March and ordered bars and restaurants to conduct only delivery services amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. In a statement, Mayor Ravi Bhalla said all residents of Hoboken, New Jersey, will be required to remain in their homes between 10 pm and 5 am, \\u201cexcept for emergencies, or if you are required to work by your employer\\u201d. The mayor said that bars and restaurants in the city will not be allowed to serve food from Sunday, 11 a.m. local time. However, they will be allowed to conduct delivery services. Hoboken reported its first case of coronavirus on Friday. More than 2,900 cases of coronavirus and at least 57 deaths have been reported in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. An Uzbek citizen has tested positive for coronavirus after returning from France, Uzbekistan\\u2019s Healthcare Ministry said on Sunday, marking the first infection from the virus in the Central Asian country of 34 million. It said it was taking the necessary measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Uzbekistan\\u2019s state airline said on Sunday it was suspending or curbing flights to a number of cities in Western Europe, Asia and the Middle East until the end of April. The Jakarta Post reports that the Indonesian transportation minister, Budi Karya Sumadi, has tested positive for coronavirus and is being treated in hospital. New South Wales, Australia attorney general Mark Speakman has announced that \\u201call new Supreme and District Court jury trials will be suspended until further notice,\\u201d from Monday, 16 March. \\u201cJury trials already underway will continue,\\u201d he said in a statement. \\u201cVisitors not involved in proceedings are asked to stay away from any NSW court building and measures will also be implemented to reduce contact between parties in current matters. \\u201cThe Local Court will also implement greater use of Audio Visual Link technology to minimise the number of people in court.\\u201d The Australian state of Queensland has confirmed fifteen new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 55, including three passengers from the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. This post has been corrected to reflect a correction in the number of new cases made by the Queensland government. Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will debate against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday. As the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates return to the debate stage, their party, the stakes, and the world look much different than in their last meeting less than three weeks ago, AP reports. The fast-moving coronavirus was something of an afterthought in that debate; now the escalating crisis is likely to dominate Sunday\\u2019s contest. The coronavirus crisis rapidly upended plans for Sunday\\u2019s debate. First, the Democratic National Committee announced that it would hold the contest without a live audience. Then the debate was moved from a large venue in Arizona, one of the states holding a primary Tuesday, to a television studio in Washington because of concerns about cross-country travel. One of the moderators had to withdraw because of potential exposure to a person who tested positive for coronavirus. For Biden, the outbreak of a global pandemic has been a moment to bolster the central argument of his candidacy: that his eight years as vice president give him the experience, as well as the relationships in Washington and around the world, that are needed in the Oval Office during turbulent times. Central American countries took further and tougher steps to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus on Saturday with measures ranging from bans on large gatherings to travel restrictions, Reuters reports. El Salvador\\u2019s Congress approved a series of emergency measures sought by President Nayib Bukele to prevent the spread of the virus and to fend off the risk of a public health crisis. The measures include restrictions on entry to and exit from El Salvador, as well as curbs on public gatherings. El Salvador has so far not reported any cases of coronavirus. Earlier, Honduras and Guatemala banned public gatherings to prevent the virus from spreading as quickly as it has in Asian and European countries. Panama had already banned large gatherings. Meanwhile, authorities in Panama said flights arriving from Europe and Asia would be temporarily suspended, with the exception of flights that transport doctors, medical equipment or other humanitarian aid. An influential former Chinese property executive who called President Xi Jinping a \\u201cclown\\u201d over a speech he made last month about the government\\u2019s efforts to battle the coronavirus has gone missing, three of his friends told Reuters. Ren Zhiqiang, a member of China\\u2019s ruling Communist Party and a former top executive of state-controlled property developer Huayuan Real Estate Group, has not been contactable since March 12, they said. \\u201cMany of our friends are looking for him,\\u201d his close friend and businesswoman Wang Ying said in a statement to Reuters, describing them as being \\u201cextremely anxious\\u201d. \\u201cRen Zhiqiang is a public figure and his disappearance is widely know. The institutions responsible for this need to give a reasonable and legal explanation for this as soon as possible,\\u201d she said. Calls made by Reuters to Ren\\u2019s mobile phone went unanswered. The Beijing police did not immediately respond to requests by phone and fax for comment on Sunday. China\\u2019s State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. An essay Ren shared with people he knew in recent weeks took aim at a speech Xi made on 23 February. Copies of his essay were later posted online by others. In the essay, which does not mention Xi by name, Ren said after studying the speech he \\u201csaw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his \\u2018new clothes,\\u2019 but a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor,\\u201d according to a version posted by China Digital Times, a U.S.-based website. Ren\\u2019s disappearance comes as censorship over how local media and online users discuss the epidemic has tightened in recent weeks. America has no real public health system \\u2013 coronavirus has a clear run, writes Robert Reich, former US secretary of labor and professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley. As the coronavirus outbreak in the US follows the same grim exponential growth path first displayed in Wuhan, China, before herculean measures were put in place to slow its spread there, America is waking up to the fact that it has almost no public capacity to deal with it. Instead of a public health system, we have a private for-profit system for individuals lucky enough to afford it and a rickety social insurance system for people fortunate enough to have a full-time job. At their best, both systems respond to the needs of individuals rather than the needs of the public as a whole. In America, the word \\u201cpublic\\u201d \\u2013 as in public health, public education or public welfare \\u2013 means a sum total of individual needs, not the common good. In Australia, here is everything we know about the new self-isolation requirement: And here is what the government has told people about a lockdown, an option it says is still on the table: In the US, Yale University has confirmed its first case of coronavirus and asked students not to return to campus, according to an email sent to students and shared with the Guardian. Yale President Peter Salovey writes: Earlier today, Director of Yale Health Paul Genecin notified us that a member of our community has tested positive for Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) on a preliminary test, and that we await confirmation of this result. Another community member and a household contact are also undergoing diagnostic evaluation, and we await test results for these individuals. The Ivy League university had previously asked students to remain at home through April 5th. It has now decided that students will be kept off campus and teaching will be conducted online for the entire spring semester, including final examinations. The Guardian understands the Spring semester ends on 6 May. \\u201cI hasten to note one vital exception: Yale will house those students who simply cannot go home, whether because they come from a country severely affected by Covid-19, or for other serious reasons,\\u201d says Salovey. The university has asked students not to return to campus to retrieve their belongings, and only staff \\u201cwhose work is deemed critical to current operations\\u201d are expected to return to work. The Australian Society of Anaesthetists is calling for all elective surgeries to be postponed to to the increased demand on hospital resources due to the coronavirus pandemic. ASA President Dr Suzi Nou said in a statement: We are calling for the immediate postponement of elective surgery that can be safely deferred \\u2013 a few weeks of inconvenience now could save many lives down the line. The reality is that we will still be performing emergency surgery while at the same time dealing with this new emergency which will put enormous strain on our critical care services. Elective surgery uses resources that may be life-saving down the line. Postponing this surgery can be a staged approach. We can act today by safely postponing surgery for patients that are going to require admission to an intensive care unit.

The number of confirmed coronavirus infections in Japan rose to 1,484 on Sunday, increasing by a faster pace than the previous day, public broadcaster NHK reported. The total number of infections includes 697 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship and 14 returnees on charter flights from China, according to NHK data. Deaths in the country related to the virus stand at 29, up one from the previous day. The total number of deaths include 7 from the cruise ship. Argentina has banned entry to non-residents who have traveled to a country highly affected by coronavirus in the last 14 days, the government officially announced late on Saturday. The ban was established for 30 days, according to the decree published in the official bulletin. The bulletin did not specify which countries would be included in the ban, though Argentina already temporarily stopped issuing visas to travellers from the United States, China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Britain and many European countries. Argentina now has 45 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the health ministry said, up from 21 on March 12. An update on American Airlines reducing its flights now: it plans to cut 75% of its international flights through May 6 and ground nearly all of its widebody fleet, the company said on Saturday. The dramatic announcement by the largest US airline came hours after the White House said the United States would widen new travel restrictions on Europeans to include travellers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, starting Monday night. South Australia has reported one new case of coronavirus, bringing the state\\u2019s total to 20. Tasmania, Australia has suspended all cruise ship visits to its ports after the island state recorded its sixth coronavirus case, AAP reports. Shortly after the announcement, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said the entire country will ban cruise ships from foreign ports for an initial 30 days. Tasmanian premier Peter Gutwein said he will direct TasPorts, which runs the state\\u2019s ports, to suspend all cruise ship visits until June 30, as a precautionary measure. A domestic cruise ship, carrying 43 mainly local passengers and which has been in Tasmanian waters since December 31, will make a final call to Hobart port on Sunday afternoon. No passengers will disembark and it will depart later in the day. Twelve cruise ship visits are scheduled during the period to June 30, including five to Hobart, five to Burnie and two to Port Arthur. About 1400 passengers and staff abroad the Magnifica, which arrived in Hobart on Saturday, were told they could not return to the ship if they disembark, an MSC Cruises spokeswoman has told The Mercury. Nobody on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers\\u2019 health. P&amp;O Cruises Australia on Saturday announced a 30-day pause in cruise operations to the impact of coronavirus. Still in Australia for a moment \\u2013 just to wrap up that presser from Prime Minister Morrison and Deputy Chief Medical Officer Kelly, Australia is enforcing a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine for all travellers, including Australians, arriving from overseas. Morrison says this requirement is legally enforceable, though he didn\\u2019t have the details of precisely how that might work or what the penalties for non-compliance might be. Schools will remain open. No more handshakes. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no herd immunity,\\u201d says Dr Kelly. The US source is a \\u201cmajor source\\u201d of cases in Australia, says Morrison. The conference is over now, with a final message from the prime minister: \\u201cSo long as Australians keep being Australians we\\u2019ll get through this together.\\u201d Australian prime minister Scott Morrison says he hopes Australians will not lose their \\u201csense of Australianness\\u201d, in response to a question about how social distancing might work: Is social distancing being instructedto schools, kids in schools? How is social distancing going to work? It\\u2019s pretty straightforward. 1.5m, you are about 1.5m away. Ensuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless its close family and friends. It\\u2019s all common sense. We don\\u2019t need to tell Australians how to get out of bed in the morning and put their shoes and socks on and things like that. Australians understand, these are important, normal, social interaction measures that people can take an hour very intuitive and all about reducing the amount of direct physical contact you have with others... I really want Australians to get on with their lives as normally as possible but there will be disruptions and they will adjust, Australians can of course adjust. What I hope won\\u2019t happened and I\\u2019m sure it won\\u2019t is that we won\\u2019t lose our sense of Australianness and all of this, we will support each other and if you have someone in self isolation, an elderly person next to you or down the road, they will be wisely exercising greater precautions about their social interactions. Make them a casserole and leave it on the door. Question: What is the penalty for committing the offence of not self-isolating? Morrison: That will be a matter for the states and territories. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison is addressing media now. He says of the new self-quarantine requirement for all travellers arriving from overseas, including Australians: Its legal enforcement, that will be the change. If your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence so I think it\\u2019s up to all of us that we are ensuring it is in place. Australians will exercise commonsense. This provides the backstop of a legal enforcement. Morrison says of cabinet: It will now be meeting more regularly by video-conferencing rather than all cabinet members being in the one place, the national cabinet as it did today met through a secure audio-conferencing facility. Leaders and other politicians, you can expect to see not travelling as much. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison: \\u201cNo more handshakes.\\u201d Australian deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly says: We are also starting to see, here in Sydney but other cities and into our regional areas, some human to human transmission in Australia. Not necessarily related to travel, that will be the next step, more proportionate measures will need to be taken as that develops. These are difficult times and the disruption to societies very much felt by us in the health side of government. Dr Paul Kelly, Australia\\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, says \\u2013 he seems to mean this reassuringly: What is different about Australia is that we are not yet in winter. All of the places we are seeing this virus really escalate quickly now, to other parts of the world, are in the northern hemisphere. They are in the latter part of their winter months. They have flu seasons as well and all of the environmental elements that allow viruses to spread quickly are actually there in North America, in China, in other parts of northern Asia and we are seeing exactly what has happened there. In particular, not taking another action probably early enough in most of those countries. Australian deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly is speaking now. He says: The important issue of herd immunity that we talk about a lot in vaccination is exactly the challenge that we have at the moment. There\\u2019s no herd immunity, everyone is susceptible to this virus in Australia. On the decision not to close schools, Morrison says it was made for two reasons. One was the need to keep children from infecting other people outside schools. Second was the massive disruption it would cause on the economy. Here is what he said: When you take children out of schools and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases the risk, and that is the understanding we have. There are also issues of herd immunity to elect children as well... And we may want to touch on those issues. The other issue is the disruption impact that they can have and put a great risk, the availability of critical workers such as nurses and doctors and others who are essential in the community because they would have to remain home and look after the children, and so while it may seem anti-intuitive, there is very good reasons why you would not be moving to broadscale closures of schools, that could make the situation worse, not better, and so the states and territories are not moving in that direction, we will consider this again at our meeting after Tuesday night. Morrison also announces new social distancing measures. Non-essential static gatherings of more than 500 people occurring across the states and territories will be banned. This recommendation will be overseen by the state and territory governments although Morrison said the police would not be enforcing it. He called on common sense judgment to carry it out. Specfic guidelines coming about what restrictions could be placed on Anzac Day celebrations on 25 April. Aged care visiting guidelines are a priority, he says, and will be announced soon. School closures could be counter-productive, he says. Scott Morrison says there will be universal self-isolation for 14 days for all arrivals at airports and cruise terminals starting from midnight tonight. Morrison says he\\u2019s compared notes with his UK counterpart, Boris Johnson. He doesn\\u2019t say whether that has inspired him to copy Britain\\u2019s controversial \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d strategy where you hope millions get a mild dose and therefore immunise themselves. Australia\\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, is giving a media conference now. It\\u2019s quite general stuff but the main point is that the government is trying to contain the spread and therefore ease the burden on hospitals. The national security council has discussed the country\\u2019s emergency response plan, he says, and will continue to be driven by medical advice. Many people will get the virus, but for eight out of 10 it will be mild and will pass. But for older people and those with existing conditons it will be serious. Our main aim is to protect the vulnerable, he says. We can\\u2019t stop the virus but we can stop the spread, he said. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will announce a multi-billion dollar economic stimulus on Tuesday as the country awakens to the shock measures needed to fight Covid-19, AAP reports. On Saturday, Ardern announced almost all international arrivals, including Kiwi citizens, would be required to self-isolate for a fortnight on their return from overseas. The decision will have significant ramifications for the New Zealand economy, particularly the travel industry on which the South Pacific nation is deeply reliant. The two new confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country \\u2013 announced earlier today \\u2013 are an Australian man in 60s who arrived in Wellington from Brisbane on March 14; and woman in her 30s from Denmark who arrived in Auckland on March 10, then flew to Christchurch, Stuff.nz reports. In Australia, the state of New South Wales has confirmed 22 new coronavirus cases. NSW Health has updated the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the state to 134. That\\u2019s 22 new cases confirmed in the 24 hours from 11 am Saturday to 11 am Sunday. Of the new cases, three people had recently travelled to the United States and their overseas travel is considered the likely source. Another case had returned from Singapore and another from the Philippines. Five have caught the infection after contact with other confirmed cases of Covid-19. The source for the remainder of the 22 new cases is still being investigated. One of the cases under investigation is a 40-year-old man who had also recently travelled to the US and another 32-year-old man was also listed as having recently travelled overseas. Some other data from NSW Health: The total number of cases that are under investigation as possible Covid-19 cases is 1924. 20,511 other people have returned negative tests for Covid-19. There\\u2019s a new coronavirus meme: people \\u2013 and trams \\u2013 as hand sanitisers. Here is Harry Styles: Here are Melbourne trams: Here is lil Uzi Vert: UK trade secretary Liz Truss: Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet: In the Philippines, police have started sealing off metropolitan Manila, home to more than 12 million people, AP reports. Thousands of police, backed by the army and coast guard, started sealing the densely populated capital from most domestic travellers Sunday in one of south-east Asia\\u2019s most drastic containment moves against the new coronavirus. Mayors also announced plans to impose a night curfew in metropolitan Manila. Residents have been asked to stay home except for work and urgent errands under month-long restrictions that took effect Sunday. The city-wide quarantine means the suspension of domestic travel by land, air and sea to and from the capital region. Large gatherings like concerts, movies and cockfighting will be prohibited and most government work in executive department offices will be suspended in the metropolis. School closures at all levels were extended by a month. Officials said the temporary restrictions will not amount to a lockdown of the capital because many workers and emergency personnel like medical staff will be able to enter and leave the capital. Residents can move within the metropolis on their way to work or for urgent errands, including medical emergencies, officials said. In Australia, Dr Adam Visser, the director of critical care at Toowoomba hospital in regional Queensland, has posted an impassioned plea for the Australian community to take individual action to help \\u201cflatten the curve\\u201d and keep intensive care units from being overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases. I\\u2019m an intensive care specialist in a small city. Coronavirus isn\\u2019t just like the flu, but it\\u2019s only really very dangerous to the elderly or the already unwell. Quite a lot of people in their 80s will die, but most of the rest of us will probably be OK. If you\\u2019re in your 70s and you get Coronavirus, you\\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\\u2019ve got a bed for you. If you\\u2019re in your 60s and you have a heart attack, you\\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\\u2019ve got a bed for you. If you\\u2019re in your 50s and need bowel cancer surgery, you\\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\\u2019ve got a bed for you. If you\\u2019re in your 40s and have a bad car accident, you\\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\\u2019ve got a bed for you. If you\\u2019re in your 30s and have terrible pre-eclampsia as a complication of pregnancy, you\\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\\u2019ve got a bed for you. If you\\u2019re in your 20s and have a bad reaction to a party drug, you\\u2019ve got a really good chance of survival. If I\\u2019ve got a bed for you. I have 7 beds equipped with life support machines. We have a plan to increase to about 25. Getting more isn\\u2019t a matter or more equipment or more money, that bit is easy. There are not enough skilled staff, even if we all work double shifts every day for six months (and we probably will). If 50% of my city gets infected, that\\u2019s 75,000 people. If 5% of them need life support (which is the estimate), that\\u2019s 3750 people. For 25 beds. And then I might not have a bed for you. So it\\u2019s up to you to flatten the curve. Wash your hands. Stay home. Visser finished his post asking the prime minister to \\u201clock down\\u201d Australia to halt the spread of Covid-19. In transport news that\\u2019s a little more fun: Meanwhile, social media users are posting pictures from US airports \\u2013 Chicago O\\u2019Hare International Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas \\u2013 showing general chaos and tightly packed crowds. In the US, United Airlines Co said late Saturday it would begin cutting flights to the United Kingdom after Washington expanded travel restrictions to Britain and Ireland, and Southwest Airlines moved toward flight cuts as the coronavirus outbreak sapped demand. Delta Airlines Inc also said it planned to start cutting flights to the United Kingdom. Southwest, one of the few U.S. airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was \\u201cseriously considering\\u201d cutting flights. US Vice President Mike Pence said restrictions on the UK and Ireland will begin Monday at midnight, barring most non-U.S. citizens from entering the United States who have been in those countries within the last 14 days. They do not bar flights to and from the United States, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel. US airlines are scrambling to shore up capital. Among cost-cutting measures, airlines are offering employees voluntary unpaid leaves of absence to match staffing with flights. On Friday, Delta said it would cut capacity 40% in the next few months, the largest reduction in its history. It will eliminate nearly all flights to continental Europe for 30 days and will park up to 300 aircraft. United and American Airlines also announced cuts to European service this week. In Australia, the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says the country will need to look at tougher travel rules, similar to those that have been enacted in New Zealand, to slow the spread of Covid-19. And he says restrictions should be in place for travellers from the United States. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little difficult to explain why say China, who have very few new cases, there are travel bans there, but the United States, people are free to travel when we\\u2019re seeing many, many new cases and indeed the majority of Victoria\\u2019s new cases are connected to those who have travelled from the United States,\\u201d Andrews said at a media conference on Sunday. He said he would be arguing for tougher measures during today\\u2019s meeting of the new national cabinet set up to deal with Covid-19. \\u201cI think that arrangements similar to New Zealand will absolutely be on the agenda to be discussed today\\u201d. New Zealand now requires all travellers entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days to try to stop the spread of the virus. Andrews said he would also move \\u201cswiftly\\u201d to close Victorian schools if and when he has such advice from health authorities. \\u201cIt\\u2019s much more likely when, rather than if,\\u201d he said. In Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson news, it appears that so far the couple have not passed on their coronavirus infections \\u2013 which they announced earlier this week \\u2013 to any members of the cast and crew of the Elvis Presley biopic they are in Australia to film. A representative for the production said no cast or crew had come down with the virus although production had ceased for two weeks. \\u201cWe are aware of only the one case of the coronavirus amongst our cast and crew, and additionally the cast member\\u2019s wife,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWorking closely with the Queensland Health Department we have delayed our start date by approximately two weeks to allow for the cast member\\u2019s full recovery.\\u201d Hanks tweeted on Friday that the pair were \\u201ctaking it one day at a time\\u201d while in isolation in a Gold Coast, Queensland hospital. New Zealand has confirmed two new cases of coronavirus, one of which is an Australian man. We\\u2019ll have more on this soon. In Australia, the Sydney climate strike scheduled for 15 May has been cancelled, School Strike 4 Climate has announced on Facebook. The post adds: \\u201cThe good news is that we are still intending to hold powerful online activities for May 15 and will be in touch about this once the plan has been confirmed. The fight for climate justice continues!\\u201d A 78-year-old Canadian who was on a cruise ship isolated in Brazil\\u2019s northeastern port of Recife tested positive for coronavirus, Brazilian TV network Globo reported on Saturday, citing a press conference. The ship with 609 people on board has been isolated in Recife since Thursday morning after this passenger showed symptoms similar to those of the new coronavirus. An Irish woman who was also in the cruise ship is also being tested. The remaining passengers and crew members are still being kept in isolation in their cabins. The vessel, with the Bahamas flag, came from the Brazilian port city of Salvador. The Pernambuco state health secretariat did not immediately confirm the report. Brazil\\u2019s health ministry confirmed 121 coronavirus cases in the country in Saturday, 23 more than on Friday. In an attempt to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the two most hit by the virus, ordered schools to shut down. South Korea reported 76 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the country\\u2019s total to 8,162 with 75 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The latest numbers are in line with a downward trend in new cases, down from the 107 recorded on Saturday. Mexico has registered a rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases to 41 \\u2013 from 26 a day earlier, the Mexican health ministry said on Saturday. The country has not confirmed any deaths from the fast-spreading virus. The country\\u2019s 33 million students will head into earlier and longer Easter vacations at the end of next week after Education Minister Esteban Moctezuma on Saturday announced measures to help avoid the spread of the coronavirus. Earlier this week, governments of El Salvador, Panama and Peru all ordered short-term suspension of classes. There\\u2019s a fairly heartbreaking video out of Italy, showing the striking increase in obituaries in daily Italian newspaper L\\u2019Eco di Bergamo. Bergamo is a city northeast of Milan. The video compares the obituary pages on 9 February 2020 and 13 March 2020: One of the world\\u2019s most respected economists, Mohamed El-Erian, has doubled down on his warnings about the scale of the economic shock resulting from the coronavirus crisis. The chief economic adviser to the insurance company Allianz has written for Bloomberg about what he calls the \\u201chuge paradigm shift for economies, institutions, and social norms and practices\\u201d now affecting the whole world. El-Erian, who voiced his concerns to the Guardian three days ago, goes on to say that the impact will be greater than anything experienced by most people in advanced countries \\u2013 presumably meaning all those under the age of 75 who can\\u2019t remember the second world war or the 1930s depression. Here is an excerpt from his piece: Think of what is happening as a huge paradigm shift for economies, institutions, and social norms and practices that, critically, are not wired for such a phenomenon. It requires us to understand the dynamics, not only to navigate them well but also to avoid behaviours that make the situation a lot worse. The bottom line is that the economic disruptions immediately ahead will be more severe and widespread than the ones experienced by the bulk of the population in advanced countries. We live in a global economy wired for ever deepening interconnectivity; and we are living through a period in which the current phase of health policy \\u2014 emphasising social distancing, separation and isolation \\u2014 runs counter to what drives economic growth, prosperity and financial stability. The effects of these two basic factors will be amplified by the economics of fear and uncertainty that tempt everyone not just to clear out supermarket shelves but sadly also reignite terrible conscious and unconscious biases. Australia\\u2019s new national cabinet is set to meet Sunday. The country\\u2019s confirmed cases of coronavirus now stand at over 250 and the government is facing questions about the possible closure of schools and tighter border controls, Reuters reports. The government has already advised against non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, though this does not include schools, airports or public transport. The national cabinet which includes federal, state and territory leaders, dubbed a \\u201cwar cabinet\\u201d by the media, will hold its first meeting via teleconference on Sunday to discuss the response to the spread of the virus. The meeting is expected to canvas whether schools should be closed and whether border controls should be further tightened to contain Covid-19. \\u201cWe are rightly, keeping all options on the table, whether it\\u2019s in relation to travel or whether it\\u2019s in relation to schools. The schools question will be very much guided by the medical advice,\\u201d Health Minister Greg Hunt told ABC television. \\u201cOne of the things that they have talked about, is not moving too early on something like that.\\u201d Visitors who have been in high-risk nations are already banned from entering Australia, while New Zealand on Saturday said it would require incoming travellers, including its own citizens, to self-isolate for two weeks. In Australia, Nine news is reporting that a group of Australian surfers are stuck on their boat in an Indonesian port after they were prevented from disembarking due to measures in place to limit the spread of coronavirus. The men told Nine they were down to their last supplies of food and water and they had contacted the Australian government seeking assistance. Guardian Australia has asked the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for comment and to confirm if they are assisting. Morale boosting efforts deployed from balconies are catching on in Portugal, it seems. A Twitter user has alerted us to this video of people applauding for healthcare workers.

Apple Inc said it is closing all its retail stores, except those in Greater China, for the next two weeks to minimize the risk of coronavirus transmission, a move that was followed by several U.S. retailers on Saturday. Apple\\u2019s hourly workers will continue to receive pay in alignment with business as usual operation, Cook said, and online sales will continue as usual, said CEO Tim Cook. Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc., which owns brands including Anthropologie and Free People, said on Saturday it was closing all of its consumer stores worldwide until at least March 28. The company also said it would continue to pay its store employees while stores are closed. Verizon Communications Inc. said it was temporarily closing \\u201ca number of its stores\\u201d across the United States in order to expand its work from home policy to include some of its retail employees. Retailers are bracing for a blow to sales as virus-wary shoppers in Europe and the United States stay home. US retailers including Macy\\u2019s Inc, Saks Fifth Avenue and Gap Inc.\\u2019s Banana Republic sent notices to shoppers on Thursday saying they were open for business in a move to stem losses due to a steep decline in traffic. An update on the new confirmed cases from overseas in mainland China now, which for the second day surpassed the number of locally transmitted new infections. Mainland China had 20 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections on March 14, up from 11 cases a day earlier. Of Saturday\\u2019s cases, 16 involved travellers entering China from overseas, it said. The remaining four cases were recorded in the city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have first begun. Saturday also marked the tenth consecutive day where Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, recorded zero new infections outside Wuhan. Of the 16 imported cases, 5 were found in the capital Beijing and three in Shanghai. The provinces of Zhejiang, Gansu and Guangdong respectively reported four, three and one cases. The Shanghai case involved a Chinese native who lived in the Italian city of Milan, and travelled back to China via Frankfurt on March 12, the government said. The Gansu government said one of its cases was found on a charter flight from Iran while the other two were travellers from Saudi Arabia. In the US, Georgia\\u2019s presidential primaries, which were set to take place on 24 March, have been postponed until May because of fears over the new coronavirus, state election officials announced Saturday, a day after Louisiana also pushed back its primaries, becoming the first state to postpone its presidential primaries due to the virus. In addition to public safety, one of the biggest considerations was the risk the virus posed to poll workers, who are often older, election officials said. Georgia is reporting 66 confirmed cases, with most concentrated around metro Atlanta. One death in the state has been attributed to the virus. Staying in Australia for the moment, AAP reports that there is \\u201cslight optimism that Australian shares will have a positive start on Monday after the Futures market ended with a small gain over the weekend.\\u201d CommSec chief economist Craig James said the \\u201camazing\\u201d turnaround in the US markets on Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1985 points, or 9.4% and the Futures also finished higher augured well for Monday\\u2019s opening. He said US President Donald Trump declaring a national emergency late last week over the fast-spreading coronavirus had a positive impact on the share market. However, investors would react more positively if the number of people contracting coronavirus stabilised or even better, started to decline, Mr James. \\u201cWhat investors want to see is a stabilisation of the Covid19 active cases globally, but if we saw a stabilisation in Australia that would certainly be encouraging for our local market.\\u201d In Australia, eight more Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in Victoria, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the state to 57. The new cases include six men and two women with ages ranging from their teens to 60s. The Victorian health department wrote in a press release: One is a student \\u2013 a known contact of case 17, a teacher from Carey Grammar. The student was not at school during their infectious period. The school will remain closed until the holidays. And, as a precaution, 12 classmates will home-isolate. All cases are recovering at home in isolation. All were acquired overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19. At the present time, there remains only one confirmed case of Covid-19 in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission. More on Trump\\u2019s negative result now. The White House released the test results Saturday night after Trump \\u2013 a self-described germaphobe \\u2013 told reporters hours earlier that he had taken the coronavirus test, following days of resisting being screened despite the fact that he had been in recent contact with three people who have tested positive for the virus, including members of the Brazilian president\\u2019s delegation who visited with him at his Florida resort, AP reports. Trump told reporters at a White House briefing on Saturday that he had his temperature taken and it was \\u201ctotally normal,\\u201d shortly before stepping into the room to discuss the government\\u2019s efforts to halt the spread of the virus. The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the U.S. and caused at least 50 deaths. The president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus, including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. The president, according to two people close to the White House, had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance. He hasn\\u2019t yet tweeted about the result. Just in case you missed this, Donald Trump has tested negative for coronavirus. A White House physician has issued a statement confirming that Donald Trump does not have Covid-19. It comes after the US president confirmed he had been tested for the virus at a press briefing earlier on Saturday.

Hello and welcome to today\\u2019s coronavirus liveblog. US President Donald Trump has tested negative, the Spanish PM\\u2019s wife has tested positive, and more countries are announcing states of emergency, lockdowns and partial shutdowns. Donald Trump has tested negative. Trump\\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time). The Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher. A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the British government\\u2019s plan to achieve \\u201cherd immunity\\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group said that enforcing social distancing now could save \\u201cthousands of lives\\u201d. The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The Spanish PM\\u2019s wife has tested positive for coronavirus. The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\\u2019s wife, Bego\\u00f1a G\\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. Israel has \\u2013 like France and Spain \\u2013 announced a partial closure of the country. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. Libya\\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. The NHS will form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\\u2019s publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients.\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 12, \"content_len\": 31415}, {\"title\": \"CD Projekt Red Announces \\u2018Cyberpunk 2077\\u2019 Will Have A Gender-Neutral Character Creator, However Everyone Will Be Christian\", \"url\": \"https://ogn.theonion.com/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-will-have-a-g-1835946085\", \"content\": \"CD Projekt Red has already dropped a lot of fascinating info about Cyberpunk 2077 recently, including tons of information on the in-depth character-creation system.

The roar when Derrell Olpherts scored a sensational one-handed try was what one would expect in this part of the world. The rendition of Sweet Caroline which accompanies every Castleford Tigers victory was, for anyone who has heard it before, routine. But this was not an ordinary day. Rugby league found itself as the only frontline act on a scant Sunday of sporting action. Barring another act of defiance from the sport\\u2019s authorities when clubs meet in Huddersfield on Monday, this was the last scrap of sporting normality for some time. At best rugby league fans will have the option to watch round eight of the Super League season from television if the games are played behind closed doors. The alternative is following the rest of British sport and shutting down for a few weeks. The feeling from many outsiders of how perplexing it has been for rugby league to carry on regardless was shared by supporters here. \\u201cWe shouldn\\u2019t be playing,\\u201d said Dave, a St Helens supporter, before the match. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a social responsibility to protect fans and help public health.\\u201d He and hundreds of Saints supporters travelled across the M62 to see the reigning champions slump to a fourth defeat in seven league games, against a Castleford side who were much the stronger of the two sides. \\u201cIt\\u2019s admirable that rugby league tries to carry on when everyone else has stopped but it could be to the detriment of the health of fans, players and officials, which can\\u2019t be a good thing,\\u201d said Alex, a Castleford fan from Sheffield. The rugby felt somewhat immaterial on a day such as this, though Castleford did their best to make a spectacle, given the extra publicity for the sport. \\u201cIt was typical Castleford and that pleased me \\u2013 but there\\u2019s an eerie feeling everywhere at the minute,\\u201d their coach, Daryl Powell, said. \\u201cRugby league is pretty parochial in terms of the towns it\\u2019s played in, and it would be difficult without it. It\\u2019s a confusing scenario and I\\u2019m looking forward to getting an indication from the RFL on it.\\u201d Castleford scored five tries to St Helens\\u2019 three to move joint-top of the table, including two well\\u2011taken finishes from Olpherts, the latter of which was a sublime one-handed effort in the corner. The visitors \\u2013 who have now lost as many games this year by mid-March as they did in the whole of last season in all competitions \\u2013 were, in contrast, woeful. It may not matter too much if the season is postponed this week but something is yet to click for the Saints under their new coach, Kristian Woolf. Tommy Makinson scored their only points of the first half but by the time he did it was 14-4. Their other two tries came in the final seven minutes; by then, the game was long gone. For now it is all eyes on the RFL. The governing body\\u2019s chief executive, Ralph Rimmer, said before the game that no options are off the table, they will continue to follow government advice and, perhaps most bizarrely, it is still not ruling out sanctions against Leeds for their refusal to fulfil their fixture in Catalans on Saturday, after a player was tested for coronavirus \\u2013 a test which came back negative. Here Castleford\\u2019s players were able to celebrate with their supporters post-match and in any other season this kind of victory would leave most associated with the Tigers encouraged about what is to follow over the next few weeks.

The money may not only prove to be a drop in a rising ocean, but it must surely be extended to cover development of technology that allows carbon to be utilised. Not only do such technologies allow emissions to be cut, but they also generate a net economic benefit, which can offset the costs of storage. Overall offering a real step towards a sustainable net-zero carbon economy. Of course, developing the utilisation technologies within CCUS (carbon capture, usage and storage) may require a larger investment than the \\u00a3800m pledged for CCS alone, but the environmental benefits and long-term cost-effectiveness of the total CCUS deployment would make this worthwhile.

Earlier this year Australians were reeling from a summer of drought and fire, but we were still keeping it together. The national psyche was fortified by an outpouring of compassion and generosity at home and abroad. We held concerts, raised funds and banded together to help everyone and everything affected by the bushfires. Struggling farmers. Families who had lost everything. Koalas with bandaged paws. Where is that generosity and community spirit now? Fuelled by a news cycle of doom and gloom, a person who just weeks ago could have danced next to us as Celeste Barber and Queen raised tens of millions of dollars for fire-affected communities might now be the enemy.

Civilisation has been built on scarcity but the idea is so foreign to first-world modern life we don\\u2019t even know where to start. With all the world\\u2019s technology and knowledge at our fingertips, we\\u2019re planning to survive for months on pasta and toilet paper.

Even if you don\\u2019t have a green thumb \\u2013 or any actual space for a garden \\u2013 it\\u2019s absurd that we are right now walking straight past overflowing baskets of fresh produce so that if the shops close we can live off cans of tuna. Make sauerkraut from all the cabbages that are in season right now. Get a few heads of cauliflower and fill a dozen jars with piccalilli. Stock your pantry with pickles and ferments. Want to go a little further? Cure a leg of pork. Install the rainwater tank you\\u2019ve been thinking about. Rewire the chicken coop. Compost. Set up a window box for herbs. Dry some apple slices in the sun. Not a generation ago all of these things would have been basic household management, prudent in both fat years and lean. This isn\\u2019t about having a bunch of fancy pickles to eat, or turning your nose up at tinned beans. Re-learning lost knowledge will reduce our reliance on unstable systems.

I\\u2019m not saying we all have to live off-grid in secluded mountain cabins, but shifting a little further toward self-sufficiency and rebuilding more robust, localised economies will reduce waste, save money, reduce our environmental impact, and help us to withstand not just one pandemic, but any other shocks to our systems that might be lurking on the horizon.

In an interview on ABC\\u2019s This Week, Mnuchin acknowledged that the US economy would probably face a slowdown. But he insisted claims earlier in the week by Donald Trump\\u2019s former top economic adviser Gary Cohn that the economy was already in recession were incorrect. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think so,\\u201d Mnuchin said. \\u201cThe real issue is not the economic situation today \\u2026 this is a unique situation. We are going to have a slowdown. Later in the year economic activity will pick up as we confront this virus.\\u201d He added: \\u201cWe will use whatever tools we need to make sure the economy and hardworking Americans get through this.\\u201d But Mnuchin\\u2019s upbeat assessment came at the same time a top member of Donald Trump\\u2019s coronavirus task force, Dr Anthony Fauci, declined to rule out a \\u201cnational lockdown\\u201d of restaurants and bars, key drivers of consumer spending. \\u201cI would like to see a dramatic diminution of the personal interaction that we see in restaurants and in bars,\\u201d Fauci told CNN\\u2019s State of the Union, as he appeared to open the door to hardline measures similar to restrictions in a number of European countries. \\u201cWhatever it takes to do that, that\\u2019s what I\\u2019d like to see.\\u201d \\u201cFor a while, life is not going to be the way it used to be in the United States,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have to just accept that if we want to do what\\u2019s best for the American public.\\u201d The doctor appeared on all the main political talk shows, as the administration sought to provide public reassurance. On CNN, he was asked if it was possible that hundreds of thousands of Americans, or more, could die. \\u201cYes,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is possible. Our job, our challenge is to try and make that not happen.\\u201d Speaking to NBC, Fauci said: \\u201cAmericans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing.\\u201d Later on Sunday, a White House statement urged Americans not to \\u201choard\\u201d groceries and goods and said the president had told store and supply chain executives they should \\u201chelp Americans feel calm and safe when shelves are stocked with the items they need\\u201d. A booming economy is any incumbent president\\u2019s trump card when up for re-election. Market volatility around attempts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak has shown how exposed Trump could be in November. An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed the president losing match-ups with both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Democratic contenders set to debate in Washington. The stock markets endured a tumultuous week as the Dow Jones plunged 10% on Thursday, its worst day since 1987, before rallying on Friday as Trump declared a national emergency and other measures meant to help combat the outbreak. The House then passed a sweeping relief bill, backed by Trump and negotiated by Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which is expected to pass the Senate on Monday. But Cohn argued on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 had already \\u201ccurtailed consumer demand\\u201d and that it was \\u201cmost likely \\u2026 we are already in a recession\\u201d, a view shared by experts including Barack Obama\\u2019s former top economic adviser, Jason Furman. On Friday, he said that \\u201cat this point, this feels much worse than 2008\\u201d, the last global financial crisis. The latest numbers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which have not been updated since Friday, document 1,629 confirmed US cases of Covid-19, with 41 fatalities. Other estimates are higher and most experts think thousands of cases have not been diagnosed, in part because of a slow start to testing. Mnuchin\\u2019s confidence in the economy came in the face of state and local leaders mandating policy designed to limit exposure to the virus. Eighteen states, for example, have announced some form of school closure. In Illinois, schools will be closed from 17 March until the end of the month and St Patrick\\u2019s Day celebrations over the weekend were severely curtailed. On Sunday, Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, issued stinging criticism of Trump. \\u201cWe [state governors] are the ones who\\u2019ve had to provide the leadership because the federal government just has fallen down on this,\\u201d he told NBC\\u2019s Meet the Press. \\u201cSo they didn\\u2019t advise us to shutdown major events, sporting events, parades, we made those decisions on our own. They are not the ones that advised us to close schools, we made those decisions on our own. So we are on our own out here. I wish we had leadership from Washington, we are not getting it.\\u201d Ohio governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, has closed schools until 3 April. He said he was considering closing all bars and restaurants. \\u201cWe are certainly looking at that,\\u201d he said, also on NBC. \\u201cYou know, we started off last week closing the schools. We reduced the number of people gathered together to 100. You know, we have restricted access to our nursing homes, to our prisons. So we are taking tough steps \\u2026 Every day counts so much and you just cannot wait.\\u201d On Saturday Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, urged the White House to consider restricting domestic travel, after a fourth death in his state. \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing cases where people clearly contracted it somewhere else and brought it here,\\u201d DeSantis said. The comments came shortly after Trump \\u2013 who was tested for coronavirus on Friday and found to be clear \\u2013 expanded a European travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, and cautioned that the administration was considering domestic restrictions. On ABC, Fauci said: \\u201cTravel restrictions within the country have not been seriously discussed. I don\\u2019t see that now in the immediate future.\\u201d\", \"fake\": \"0\", \"title_len\": 11, \"content_len\": 981}, {\"title\": \"New York City teachers threaten mass \\u2018sickout\\u2019 as schools stay open amid coronavirus\", \"url\": \"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/new-york-city-coronavirus-schools-teachers\", \"content\": \"A growing revolt by teachers raised the prospect of a mass \\u201csickout\\u201d in New York City classrooms on Monday, even as Mayor Bill de Blasio continued to defend his controversial decision to keep schools open. Entire school districts in more than a dozen states have shut down operations for more than 15 million students until the coronavirus crisis has passed. Just over the Hudson river from New York the city of Hoboken, in New Jersey, has gone so far as to enforce an overnight curfew. But New York remains an anomaly, prompting a backlash from teachers unions who have attacked the decision as \\u201cirresponsible\\u201d. De Blasio, however, remains determined to keep classes in session for the school district\\u2019s million students. \\u201cMy blunt fear is if the schools shut down they will be done for the year, done for the school year, maybe even for the calendar year,\\u201d he said on CNN\\u2019s State of the Union. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m very reticent to shut down schools for a variety of reasons, not just that it\\u2019s where a lot of kids get their only good meals, but they get adult supervision, especially teenagers who otherwise would be out on the streets. There\\u2019s health and safety ramifications to that. \\u201cThose first responders, those healthcare workers who depend on the schools, they can get to work and we need those workers desperately.\\u201d De Blasio said he believed the crisis could last at least six months, and the situation was escalating daily. \\u201cBecause of community spread [coronavirus] is clearly widespread already in New York City and will continue to grow,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe had 25 confirmed cases on Monday, we have 269 this morning and that\\u2019ll grow today, we\\u2019ll clearly have a thousand cases probably not too far into next week. That doesn\\u2019t mean people should be overwhelmed. It means people have to be smart about listening to guidance from healthcare professionals.\\u201d The mayor did concede, however, that schools could close quickly if he felt the situation warranted it. \\u201cIt is literally a day-to-day reality. If we can keep our schools open we will, if at any point we feel it doesn\\u2019t make sense we will make a move,\\u201d he said, adding that preparations were in hand to care for the children of essential workers. \\u201cA variety of contingencies are being set up. They are far from perfect, let\\u2019s be clear, the distance and difference between a functioning school system program for a million kids versus creating alternative centers feeding kids of healthcare workers, that kind of thing.\\u201d De Blasio\\u2019s stance has angered teachers in the nation\\u2019s largest school district, who have watched a steady stream of classroom closures in other sizeable districts, including Los Angeles, Boston and entire states including Florida. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents about 150,000 educators in New York city schools, said De Blasio\\u2019s failure to fall in line risked students\\u2019 health. \\u201cBecause of his irresponsible decision to keep the public schools open, Mayor Bill de Blasio can no longer assure the health and safety of our students and school communities,\\u201d Mulgrew said in an email to parents. \\u201cWe have a small window of time to contain the coronavirus before it penetrates into our communities and overwhelms our healthcare system\\u2019s capacity to safely care for all the New Yorkers who may become gravely ill.\\u201d The Movement of Rank and File Educators, a faction of the UFT, has urged its members to call in sick on Monday as a protest. \\u201cTransmission is clearly already happening in the schools and the sooner it stops the fewer people will die,\\u201d the group said in a statement. The faction has sent out several tweets with the hashtag \\u201csickout\\u201d, one stating that: \\u201cIf de Blasio won\\u2019t #closenycpublicschools to protect students and their families, teachers will.\\u201d Some parents have taken the decision to keep their children home. \\u201cIt would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it\\u2019s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,\\u201d said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn. In contrast to New York\\u2019s relative freedoms, meanwhile, neighboring Hoboken has imposed a 10pm to 5am curfew on residents to try to keep coronavirus at bay. Mayor Ravi S Bhalla announced on Saturday night that exceptions would be made for emergencies and people required to work, adding that restaurants can only offer takeout and delivery services.
